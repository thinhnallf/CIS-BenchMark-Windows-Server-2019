Overview  

This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration  
posture for Microsoft Windows.  

This secure configuration guide is based on Microsoft Windows Server 2019 and is  
intended for all versions of the Server 2019 operating system, including older versions.  
This secure configuration guide was tested against Microsoft Windows Server 2019  
Datacenter.  

To ensure all new and updated group policy objects (GPOs) are installed on the system,  
please download the newest version of the ADMX/ADML templates for Server 2019.  
Templates can be downloaded from Microsoft at: Download ADMX Templates for Windows  
11 October 2021 Update [21H2] from Official Microsoft Download Center.  

To obtain the latest version of this secure configuration guide, please visit  
https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/. If you have questions, comments, or have  
identified ways to improve this guide, please write us at feedback@cisecurity.org.  

  

Intended Audience  

The Windows CIS Benchmarks are written for Active Directory domain-joined systems  
using Group Policy, not standalone/workgroup systems. Adjustments/tailoring to some  
recommendations will be needed to maintain functionality if attempting to implement CIS  
hardening on standalone systems or a system running in the cloud.  

                                       

                                                                                                          40  | P a g e

Consensus Guidance  

This benchmark was created using a consensus review process comprised of subject  
matter experts. Consensus participants provide perspective from a diverse set of  
backgrounds including consulting, software development, audit and compliance, security  
research, operations, government, and legal.  

Each CIS benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus review. The first phase occurs  
during initial benchmark development. During this phase, subject matter experts convene  
to discuss, create, and test working drafts of the benchmark. This discussion occurs until  
consensus has been reached on benchmark recommendations. The second phase begins  
after the benchmark has been published. During this phase, all feedback provided by the  
Internet community is reviewed by the consensus team for incorporation in the  
benchmark. If you are interested in participating in the consensus process, please visit  
https://workbench.cisecurity.org/.

Assessment Status  

An assessment status is included for every recommendation. The assessment status  
indicates whether the given recommendation can be automated or requires manual steps  
to implement. Both statuses are equally important and are determined and supported as  
defined below:  

Automated  

Represents recommendations for which assessment of a technical control can be fully  
automated and validated to a pass/fail state. Recommendations will include the necessary  
information to implement automation.  

Manual  

Represents recommendations for which assessment of a technical control cannot be fully  
automated and requires all or some manual steps to validate that the configured state is set  
as expected. The expected state can vary depending on the environment.  

                                       

                                                                                                        42  | P a g e

    Level 2 - Domain Controller  

     This profile extends the "Level 1 - Domain Controller" profile. Items in this profile  
     exhibit one or more of the following characteristics:  

         o    are intended for environments or use cases where security is paramount  
         o    acts as defense in depth measure  
         o    may negatively inhibit the utility or performance of the technology  

    Level 2 - Member Server  

     This profile extends the "Level 1 - Member Server" profile. Items in this profile  
     exhibit one or more of the following characteristics:  

         o    are intended for environments or use cases where security is paramount  
         o    acts as defense in depth measure  
         o    may negatively inhibit the utility or performance of the technology  

    Next Generation Windows Security - Domain Controller  

     This profile contains advanced Windows security features that have specific  
     configuration dependencies, and may not be compatible with all systems. It  
     therefore requires special attention to detail and testing before implementation. If  
     your environment supports these features, they are highly recommended as they  
     have tangible security benefits. This profile is intended to be an optional "add-on" to  
     the Level 1 or Level 2 profiles.

1.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Enforce password history' is set to '24 or more  
password(s)' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be  
associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. The value for this  
policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for Windows Vista is  
0 passwords, but the default setting in a domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the  
effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users  
from repeatedly changing their password.  

The recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s).  

Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section  
1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on  
domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another  
GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO.  
However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy  
rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings  
Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily  
configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.  

Note #2: As of the publication of this benchmark, Microsoft currently has a maximum limit

Rationale:  

The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can  
determine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have  
been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchanged. If  
password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually  
reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly  
reduced.  

If you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same small  
number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum password age  
setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can reuse their original  
password.  

Impact:  

The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time  
they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords  
to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their passwords  
somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create  
passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on)  
to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess. Also, an excessively low value for  
the Minimum password age setting will likely increase administrative overhead, because  
users who forget their passwords might ask the help desk to reset them frequently.

1.1.2 (L1) Ensure 'Maximum password age' is set to '365 or fewer days,  
but not 0' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires.  

Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the  
password will never expire.  

Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the  
less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this value  
is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users  
having to change their password or forgetting which password is current.  

The recommended state for this setting is 365 or fewer days, but not 0.  

Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section  
1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on  
domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another  
GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO.  
However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy  
rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings  
Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily  
configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.  

Rationale:  

The longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a  
brute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the user  
sharing the password. Configuring the Maximum password age setting to 0 so that users  
are never required to change their passwords is a major security risk because that allows a  
compromised password to be used by the malicious user for as long as the valid user has  
authorized access.

----------------------- Page 52-----------------------

  

Impact:  

If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their  
passwords very often. Such a configuration can reduce security in the organization,  
because users might write their passwords in an insecure location or lose them. If the value  
for this policy setting is too high, the level of security within an organization is reduced  
because it allows potential attackers more time in which to discover user passwords or to  
use compromised accounts.

1.1.3 (L1) Ensure 'Minimum password age' is set to '1 or more day(s)'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines the number of days that you must use a password before  
you can change it. The range of values for this policy setting is between 1 and 999 days.  
(You may also set the value to 0 to allow immediate password changes.) The default value  
for this setting is 0 days.  

The recommended state for this setting is: 1 or more day(s).  

Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section  
1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on  
domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another  
GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO.  
However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy  
rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings  
Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily  
configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.  

Rationale:  

Users may have favorite passwords that they like to use because they are easy to  
remember and they believe that their password choice is secure from compromise.  
Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific  
individual user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old  
passwords can cause a security breach. To address password reuse a combination of  
security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history  
setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the Enforce  
password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 passwords,  
they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the password they  
started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age setting to a number that  
is greater than 0. You must configure this policy setting to a number that is greater than 0  
for the Enforce password history setting to be effective.

Impact:  

If an administrator sets a password for a user but wants that user to change the password

day.

1.1.4 (L1) Ensure 'Minimum password length' is set to '14 or more  
character(s)' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for  
a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best  
password length for an organization, but perhaps "passphrase" is a better term than  
"password." In Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer, passphrases can be quite long and can  
include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as "I want to drink a $5 milkshake" is a valid  
passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of  
random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about  
the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password  
length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length  
setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's  
business requirements.  

The recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s).  

Note: In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the Local  
Security Policy (LSP), Local Group Policy Editor (LGPE) and Group Policy Management  
Editor (GPME) would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters. However,  
starting with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to a 20  
character minimum password length.  

Note #2: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings  
(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in  
effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in  
another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the  
GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout  
policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password  
Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily  
configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.

----------------------- Page 56-----------------------

  

Rationale:  

Types of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common words  
and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of characters).  
Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to  
discover the accounts and passwords.  

Impact:  

Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an  
organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If  
very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and  
increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten  
passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about  
passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of  
character combinations, much harder to discover.  

Note: Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not support  
passwords that are longer than 14 characters. Computers that run these older operating  
systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that use accounts that  
require long passwords.

1.1.5 (L1) Ensure 'Password must meet complexity requirements' is set  
to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements  
for strong passwords.  

When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements:  

        Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two  
         consecutive characters  
        Be at least six characters in length  
        Contain characters from three of the following categories:  
              o   English uppercase characters (A through Z)  
              o   English lowercase characters (a through z)  
              o   Base 10 digits (0 through 9)  
              o   Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %)  
              o   A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does not fall under the  
                  previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific.  

Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For  
instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267  
(approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per  
second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes  
to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527  
combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without  
punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011)  
possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000  
attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember,  
these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other  
special keyboard characters such as "!" or "@". Proper use of the password settings can  
help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack.  

                                      

                                                                                                       57  | P a g e

GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO.  
However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy  
rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings  
Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily  
configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.  

Rationale:  

Passwords that contain only alphanumeric characters are extremely easy to discover with  
several publicly available tools.  

Impact:  

If the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls for  
locked-out accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to passwords that  
contain non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to comply with the  
complexity requirement with minimal difficulty.  

If your organization has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom  
version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength  
rules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row  
characters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key  
and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform  
a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain common  
dictionary words or fragments.  

Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of a  
password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users  
and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a  
requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159  
range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard alphanumeric  
characters that would not add additional complexity to the password.)

1.1.6 (L1) Ensure 'Relax minimum password length limits' is set to  
'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether the minimum password length setting can be  
increased beyond the legacy limit of 14 characters. For more information please see the  
following Microsoft Security Blog.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Note: This setting only affects local accounts on the computer. Domain accounts are only  
affected by settings on the Domain Controllers, because that is where domain accounts are  
stored.  

Rationale:  

This setting will enable the enforcement of longer and generally stronger passwords or  
passphrases where MFA is not in use.  

Impact:  

The Minimum password length setting may be configured higher than 14 characters.  

If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and  
increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten  
passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about  
passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of  
character combinations, much harder to discover.

1.1.7 (L1) Ensure 'Store passwords using reversible encryption' is set to  
'Disabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether the operating system stores passwords in a way  
that uses reversible encryption, which provides support for application protocols that  
require knowledge of the user's password for authentication purposes. Passwords that are  
stored with reversible encryption are essentially the same as plaintext versions of the  
passwords.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section  
1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on  
domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another  
GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO.  
However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy  
rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings  
Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily  
configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.  

Rationale:  

Enabling this policy setting allows the operating system to store passwords in a weaker  
format that is much more susceptible to compromise and weakens your system security.  

Impact:  

If your organization uses either the CHAP authentication protocol through remote access or  
IAS services or Digest Authentication in IIS, you must configure this policy setting to  
Enabled. This setting is extremely dangerous to apply through Group Policy on a user-by- 
user basis, because it requires the appropriate user account object to be opened in Active  
Directory Users and Computers.

1.2 Account Lockout Policy  

This section contains recommendations for account lockout policy.  

1.2.1 (L1) Ensure 'Account lockout duration' is set to '15 or more  
minute(s)' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines the length of time that must pass before a locked account is  
unlocked and a user can try to log on again. The setting does this by specifying the number  
of minutes a locked out account will remain unavailable. If the value for this policy setting  
is configured to 0, locked out accounts will remain locked out until an administrator  
manually unlocks them.  

Although it might seem like a good idea to configure the value for this policy setting to a  
high value, such a configuration will likely increase the number of calls that the help desk  
receives to unlock accounts locked by mistake. Users should be aware of the length of time  
a lock remains in place, so that they realize they only need to call the help desk if they have  
an extremely urgent need to regain access to their computer.  

The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s).  

Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section  
1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on  
domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another  
GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO.  
However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy  
rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings  
Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily  
configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.  

                                      

                                                                                                       64  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 66-----------------------

  

Rationale:  

A denial of service (DoS) condition can be created if an attacker abuses the Account lockout  
threshold and repeatedly attempts to log on with a specific account. Once you configure the  
Account lockout threshold setting, the account will be locked out after the specified number  
of failed attempts. If you configure the Account lockout duration setting to 0, then the  
account will remain locked out until an administrator unlocks it manually.  

Impact:  

Although it may seem like a good idea to configure this policy setting to never  
automatically unlock an account, such a configuration can increase the number of requests  
that your organization's help desk receives to unlock accounts that were locked by mistake.  

Audit:  

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as  
prescribed.  

Remediation:  

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to  15 or  
more minute(s):  

Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account  
Policies\Account Lockout Policy\Account lockout duration  

Default Value:  

None, because this policy setting only has meaning when an Account lockout threshold is  
specified. When an Account lockout threshold is configured, Windows automatically  
suggests a value of 30 minutes.

1.2.2 (L1) Ensure 'Account lockout threshold' is set to '5 or fewer invalid  
logon attempt(s), but not 0' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines the number of failed logon attempts before the account is  
locked. Setting this policy to 0 does not conform to the benchmark as doing so disables the  
account lockout threshold.  

The recommended state for this setting is: 5 or fewer invalid logon attempt(s), but  
not 0.  

Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section  
1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on  
domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another  
GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO.  
However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy  
rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings  
Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily  
configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.  

Rationale:  

Setting an account lockout threshold reduces the likelihood that an online password brute  
force attack will be successful. Setting the account lockout threshold too low introduces  
risk of increased accidental lockouts and/or a malicious actor intentionally locking out  
accounts.  

                                       

                                                                                                         67  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 69-----------------------

  

Impact:  

If this policy setting is enabled, a locked-out account will not be usable until it is reset by an  
administrator or until the account lockout duration expires. This setting may generate  
additional help desk calls.  

If you enforce this setting an attacker could cause a denial of service condition by  
deliberately generating failed logons for multiple user, therefore you should also configure  
the Account Lockout Duration to a relatively low value.  

If you configure the Account Lockout Threshold to 0, there is a possibility that an attacker's  
attempt to discover passwords with a brute force password attack might go undetected if a  
robust audit mechanism is not in place.  

Audit:  

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as  
prescribed.

1.2.3 (L1) Ensure 'Reset account lockout counter after' is set to '15 or  
more minute(s)' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines the length of time before the Account lockout threshold  
resets to zero. The default value for this policy setting is Not Defined. If the Account lockout  
threshold is defined, this reset time must be less than or equal to the value for the Account  
lockout duration setting.  

If you leave this policy setting at its default value or configure the value to an interval that  
is too long, your environment could be vulnerable to a DoS attack. An attacker could  
maliciously perform a number of failed logon attempts on all users in the organization,  
which will lock out their accounts. If no policy were determined to reset the account  
lockout, it would be a manual task for administrators. Conversely, if a reasonable time  
value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for a set period until  
all of the accounts are unlocked automatically.  

The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s).  

Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section  
1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on  
domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another  
GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO.  
However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy  
rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings  
Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily  
configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.  

Rationale:  

Users can accidentally lock themselves out of their accounts if they mistype their password  
multiple times. To reduce the chance of such accidental lockouts, the Reset account lockout  
counter after setting determines the number of minutes that must elapse before the  
counter that tracks failed logon attempts and triggers lockouts is reset to 0.  

                                      

                                                                                                       70  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 72-----------------------

  

Impact:  

If you do not configure this policy setting or if the value is configured to an interval that is  
too long, a DoS attack could occur. An attacker could maliciously attempt to log on to each  
user's account numerous times and lock out their accounts as described in the preceding  
paragraphs. If you do not configure the Reset account lockout counter after setting,  
administrators would have to manually unlock all accounts. If you configure this policy  
setting to a reasonable value the users would be locked out for some period, after which  
their accounts would unlock automatically. Be sure that you notify users of the values used  
for this policy setting so that they will wait for the lockout timer to expire before they call  
the help desk about their inability to log on.  

Audit:  

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as  
prescribed.  

Remediation:  

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to  15 or  
more minute(s):  

Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account  
Policies\Account Lockout Policy\Reset account lockout counter after  

Default Value:  

None, because this policy setting only has meaning when an Account lockout threshold is  
specified. When an Account lockout threshold is configured, Windows automatically  
suggests a value of 30 minutes.

2.2.1 (L1) Ensure 'Access Credential Manager as a trusted caller' is set to  
'No One' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This security setting is used by Credential Manager during Backup and Restore. No  
accounts should have this user right, as it is only assigned to Winlogon. Users' saved  
credentials might be compromised if this user right is assigned to other entities.  

The recommended state for this setting is: No One.  

Rationale:  

If an account is given this right the user of the account may create an application that calls  
into Credential Manager and is returned the credentials for another user.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

2.2.2 (L1) Ensure 'Access this computer from the network' is set to  
'Administrators, Authenticated Users, ENTERPRISE DOMAIN  
CONTROLLERS' (DC only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

Description:  

This policy setting allows other users on the network to connect to the computer and is  
required by various network protocols that include Server Message Block (SMB)-based  
protocols, NetBIOS, Common Internet File System (CIFS), and Component Object Model  
Plus (COM+).  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, Authenticated Users,  
ENTERPRISE DOMAIN CONTROLLERS.  

Rationale:  

Users who can connect from their computer to the network can access resources on target  
computers for which they have permission. For example, the Access this computer from  
the network user right is required for users to connect to shared printers and folders. If  
this user right is assigned to the Everyone group, then anyone will be able to read the files  
in those shared folders. However, this situation is unlikely for new installations of Windows  
Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1), because the default share and NTFS permissions in  
Windows Server 2003 do not include the Everyone group. This vulnerability may have a  
higher level of risk for computers that you upgrade from Windows NT 4.0 or Windows  
2000, because the default permissions for these operating systems are not as restrictive as  
the default permissions in Windows Server 2003.

----------------------- Page 78-----------------------

  

Impact:  

If you remove the Access this computer from the network user right on Domain  
Controllers for all users, no one will be able to log on to the domain or use network  
resources. If you remove this user right on Member Servers, users will not be able to  
connect to those servers through the network. Successful negotiation of IPsec connections  
requires that the initiating machine has this right, therefore if using IPsec, it is  
recommended that it is assigned to the Authenticated Users group. If you have installed  
optional components such as ASP.NET or Internet Information Services (IIS), you may need  
to assign this user right to additional accounts that are required by those components. It is  
important to verify that authorized users are assigned this user right for the computers  
they need to access the network.

Description:  

This policy setting allows a process to assume the identity of any user and thus gain access  
to the resources that the user is authorized to access.  

The recommended state for this setting is: No One.  

Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.  

Rationale:  

The Act as part of the operating system user right is extremely powerful. Anyone with  
this user right can take complete control of the computer and erase evidence of their  
activities.  

Impact:  

There should be little or no impact because the Act as part of the operating system user  
right is rarely needed by any accounts other than the Local System account, which  
implicitly has this right.

2.2.5 (L1) Ensure 'Add workstations to domain' is set to 'Administrators'  
(DC only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

Description:  

This policy setting specifies which users can add computer workstations to the domain. For  
this policy setting to take effect, it must be assigned to the user as part of the Default  
Domain Controller Policy for the domain. A user who has been assigned this right can add  
up to 10 workstations to the domain. Users who have been assigned the Create Computer  
Objects permission for an OU or the Computers container in Active Directory can add an  
unlimited number of computers to the domain, regardless of whether or not they have  
been assigned the Add workstations to domain user right.  

In Windows-based networks, the term security principal is defined as a user, group, or  
computer that is automatically assigned a security identifier to control access to resources.  
In an Active Directory domain, each computer account is a full security principal with the  
ability to authenticate and access domain resources. However, some organizations may  
want to limit the number of computers in an Active Directory environment so that they can  
consistently track, build, and manage the computers. If users are allowed to add computers  
to the domain, tracking and management efforts would be hampered. Also, users could  
perform activities that are more difficult to trace because of their ability to create  
additional unauthorized domain computers.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.  

Rationale:  

The Add workstations to domain user right presents a moderate vulnerability. Users with  
this right could add a computer to the domain that is configured in a way that violates  
organizational security policies. For example, if your organization does not want its users  
to have administrative privileges on their computers, a user could (re-)install Windows on  
his or her computer and then add the computer to the domain. The user would know the  
password for the local Administrator account, and could log on with that account and then  
add his or her domain account to the local Administrators group.  

                                      

                                                                                                      81  | P a g e

Impact:  

For organizations that have never allowed users to set up their own computers and add  
them to the domain, this countermeasure will have no impact. For those that have allowed  
some or all users to configure their own computers, this countermeasure will force the  
organization to establish a formal process for these procedures going forward. It will not  
affect existing domain computers unless they are removed from and re-added to the  
domain.

2.2.6 (L1) Ensure 'Adjust memory quotas for a process' is set to  
'Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows a user to adjust the maximum amount of memory that is available  
to a process. The ability to adjust memory quotas is useful for system tuning, but it can be  
abused. In the wrong hands, it could be used to launch a denial of service (DoS) attack.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK  
SERVICE.  

Note: A Member Server that holds the  Web Server (IIS) Role with Web Server Role Service  
will require a special exception to this recommendation, to allow IIS application pool(s) to  
be granted this user right.  

Note #2: A Member Server with Microsoft SQL Server installed will require a special  
exception to this recommendation for additional SQL-generated entries to be granted this  
user right.  

Rationale:  

A user with the Adjust memory quotas for a process user right can reduce the amount of  
memory that is available to any process, which could cause business-critical network  
applications to become slow or to fail. In the wrong hands, this privilege could be used to  
start a denial of service (DoS) attack.  

Impact:  

Organizations that have not restricted users to roles with limited privileges will find it  
difficult to impose this countermeasure. Also, if you have installed optional components  
such as ASP.NET or IIS, you may need to assign the Adjust memory quotas for a process  
user right to additional accounts that are required by those components. Otherwise, this  
countermeasure should have no impact on most computers. If this user right is necessary  
for a user account, it can be assigned to a local computer account instead of a domain  
account.

(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines which users can interactively log on to computers in your  
environment. Logons that are initiated by pressing the CTRL+ALT+DEL key sequence on  
the client computer keyboard require this user right. Users who attempt to log on through  
Terminal Services / Remote Desktop Services or IIS also require this user right.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.  

Note: This user right should generally be restricted to the Administrators group. Assign  
this user right to the Backup Operators group if your organization requires that they have  
this capability.  

Rationale:  

Any account with the Allow log on locally user right can log on at the console of the  
computer. If you do not restrict this user right to legitimate users who need to be able to  
log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users could download and run  
malicious software to elevate their privileges.  

Impact:  

If you remove these default groups, you could limit the abilities of users who are assigned  
to specific administrative roles in your environment. You should confirm that delegated  
activities will not be adversely affected by any changes that you make to the Allow log on  
locally user right.

2.2.8 (L1) Ensure 'Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services' is set  
to 'Administrators' (DC only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

Description:  

This policy setting determines which users or groups have the right to log on as a Remote  
Desktop Services client. If your organization uses Remote Assistance as part of its help desk  
strategy, create a group and assign it this user right through Group Policy. If the help desk  
in your organization does not use Remote Assistance, assign this user right only to the  
Administrators group or use the Restricted Groups feature to ensure that no user  
accounts are part of the Remote Desktop Users group.  

Restrict this user right to the Administrators group, and possibly the Remote Desktop  
Users group, to prevent unwanted users from gaining access to computers on your  
network by means of the Remote Assistance feature.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.  

Note: A Member Server that holds the Remote Desktop Services Role with Remote Desktop  
Connection Broker Role Service will require a special exception to this recommendation, to  
allow the Authenticated Users group to be granted this user right.  

Note #2: The above lists are to be treated as whitelists, which implies that the above  
principals need not be present for assessment of this recommendation to pass.  

Note #3: In all versions of Windows Server prior to Server 2008 R2, Remote Desktop  
Services was known as Terminal Services, so you should substitute the older term if  
comparing against an older OS.  

Rationale:  

Any account with the Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services user right can log  
on to the remote console of the computer. If you do not restrict this user right to legitimate

2.2.10 (L1) Ensure 'Back up files and directories' is set to 'Administrators'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows users to circumvent file and directory permissions to back up the  
system. This user right is enabled only when an application (such as NTBACKUP) attempts to  
access a file or directory through the NTFS file system backup application programming  
interface (API). Otherwise, the assigned file and directory permissions apply.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.  

Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.  

Rationale:  

Users who are able to back up data from a computer could take the backup media to a non- 
domain computer on which they have administrative privileges and restore the data. They  
could take ownership of the files and view any unencrypted data that is contained within  
the backup set.  

Impact:  

Changes in the membership of the groups that have the Back up files and directories user  
right could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific administrative roles in

2.2.11 (L1) Ensure 'Change the system time' is set to 'Administrators,  
LOCAL SERVICE' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines which users and groups can change the time and date on the  
internal clock of the computers in your environment. Users who are assigned this user right  
can affect the appearance of event logs. When a computer's time setting is changed, logged  
events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events occurred.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE.  

Note: Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the Domain  
Controllers in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication  
protocol, which could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain  
authorization to access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will  
occur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not  
synchronized with the Domain Controllers.

----------------------- Page 95-----------------------

  

Rationale:  

Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For example,  
time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders  
that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain  
may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain from  
them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and  
authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period,  
an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain  
or grant Kerberos tickets.  

The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member  
Servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically  
synchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways:  

        All client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain  
         Controller as their inbound time partner.  
        All Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller (PDC)  
         Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner.  
        All PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the  
         selection of their inbound time partner.  
        The PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for  
         the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer to  
         synchronize with a reliable external time server.  

This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the system  
time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time  
server that is not accurate.  

Impact:  

There should be no impact, because time synchronization for most organizations should be  
fully automated for all computers that belong to the domain. Computers that do not belong  
to the domain should be configured to synchronize with an external source.

2.2.14 (L1) Ensure 'Create a token object' is set to 'No One' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows a process to create an access token, which may provide elevated  
rights to access sensitive data.  

The recommended state for this setting is: No One.  

Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.  

Rationale:  

A user account that is given this user right has complete control over the system and can  
lead to the system being compromised. It is highly recommended that you do not assign  
any user accounts this right.  

The operating system examines a user's access token to determine the level of the user's  
privileges. Access tokens are built when users log on to the local computer or connect to a  
remote computer over a network. When you revoke a privilege, the change is immediately  
recorded, but the change is not reflected in the user's access token until the next time the  
user logs on or connects. Users with the ability to create or modify tokens can change the  
level of access for any currently logged on account. They could escalate their own privileges  
or create a DoS condition.

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether users can create global objects that are available to  
all sessions. Users can still create objects that are specific to their own session if they do not  
have this user right.  

Users who can create global objects could affect processes that run under other users'

Note: A Member Server with Microsoft SQL Server and its optional "Integration Services"  
component installed will require a special exception to this recommendation for additional  
SQL-generated entries to be granted this user right.

2.2.17 (L1) Ensure 'Create symbolic links' is set to 'Administrators' (DC  
only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

Description:  

This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista,  
existing NTFS file system objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a  
new kind of file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer (much like  
a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a file, folder, shortcut or  
another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a  
shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications,  
shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is  
implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.  

Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not  
designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only  
be assigned to trusted users. By default, only Administrators can create symbolic links.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.  

Rationale:  

Users who have the Create symbolic links user right could inadvertently or maliciously  
expose your system to symbolic link attacks. Symbolic link attacks can be used to change  
the permissions on a file, to corrupt data, to destroy data, or as a Denial of Service attack.  

Impact:  

In most cases there will be no impact because this is the default configuration. However, on  
Windows Servers with the Hyper-V server role installed, this user right should also be  
granted to the special group Virtual Machines - otherwise you will not be able to create  
new virtual machines.

2.2.19 (L1) Ensure 'Debug programs' is set to 'Administrators'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines which user accounts will have the right to attach a debugger  
to any process or to the kernel, which provides complete access to sensitive and critical  
operating system components. Developers who are debugging their own applications do  
not need to be assigned this user right; however, developers who are debugging new  
system components will need it.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.  

Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.  

Rationale:  

The Debug programs user right can be exploited to capture sensitive computer  
information from system memory, or to access and modify kernel or application structures.  
Some attack tools exploit this user right to extract hashed passwords and other private  
security information, or to insert rootkit code. By default, the Debug programs user right  
is assigned only to administrators, which helps to mitigate the risk from this vulnerability.  

                                       

                                                                                                        107  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 109-----------------------

  

Impact:  

If you revoke this user right, no one will be able to debug programs. However, typical  
circumstances rarely require this capability on production computers. If a problem arises  
that requires an application to be debugged on a production server, you can move the  
server to a different OU temporarily and assign the Debug programs user right to a  
separate Group Policy for that OU.  

The service account that is used for the cluster service needs the Debug programs user  
right; if it does not have it, Windows Clustering will fail.  

Tools that are used to manage processes will be unable to affect processes that are not  
owned by the person who runs the tools. For example, the Windows Server 2003 Resource  
Kit tool Kill.exe requires this user right for administrators to terminate processes that  
they did not start.

2.2.20 (L1) Ensure  'Deny access to this computer from the network' to  
include 'Guests' (DC only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

Description:  

This policy setting prohibits users from connecting to a computer from across the network,  
which would allow users to access and potentially modify data remotely. In high security  
environments, there should be no need for remote users to access data on a computer.  
Instead, file sharing should be accomplished through the use of network servers. This user  
right supersedes the Access this computer from the network user right if an account is  
subject to both policies.  

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Guests.  

Caution: Configuring a standalone (non-domain-joined) server as described above may  
result in an inability to remotely administer the server.  

Note: The security identifier Local account and member of Administrators group is not  
available in Server 2008 R2 and Server 2012 (non-R2) unless MSKB 2871997 has been  
installed.  

Note #2: Configuring a Member Server or standalone server as described above may  
adversely affect applications that create a local service account and place it in the  
Administrators group - in which case you must either convert the application to use a  
domain-hosted service account, or remove Local account and member of  
Administrators group from this User Right Assignment. Using a domain-hosted service  
account is strongly preferred over making an exception to this rule, where possible.  

Rationale:

2.2.21 (L1) Ensure 'Deny access to this computer from the network' to  
include 'Guests, Local account and member of Administrators group'  
(MS only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting prohibits users from connecting to a computer from across the network,  
which would allow users to access and potentially modify data remotely. In high security  
environments, there should be no need for remote users to access data on a computer.  
Instead, file sharing should be accomplished through the use of network servers. This user  
right supersedes the Access this computer from the network user right if an account is  
subject to both policies.  

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Guests, Local account and member  
of Administrators group.  

Caution: Configuring a standalone (non-domain-joined) server as described above may  
result in an inability to remotely administer the server.  

Note: The security identifier Local account and member of Administrators group is not  
available in Server 2008 R2 and Server 2012 (non-R2) unless MSKB 2871997 has been  
installed.  

Note #2: Configuring a Member Server or standalone server as described above may  
adversely affect applications that create a local service account and place it in the  
Administrators group - in which case you must either convert the application to use a  
domain-hosted service account, or remove Local account and member of  
Administrators group from this User Right Assignment. Using a domain-hosted service  
account is strongly preferred over making an exception to this rule, where possible.  

Rationale:  

Users who can log on to the computer over the network can enumerate lists of account  
names, group names, and shared resources. Users with permission to access shared folders  
and files can connect over the network and possibly view or modify data.

2.2.22 (L1) Ensure 'Deny log on as a batch job' to include 'Guests'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines which accounts will not be able to log on to the computer as  
a batch job. A batch job is not a batch (.bat) file, but rather a batch-queue facility. Accounts  
that use the Task Scheduler to schedule jobs need this user right.  

This user right supersedes the Log on as a batch job user right, which could be used to  
allow accounts to schedule jobs that consume excessive system resources. Such an  
occurrence could cause a DoS condition. Failure to assign this user right to the  
recommended accounts can be a security risk.  

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Guests.  

Rationale:  

Accounts that have the Log on as a batch job user right could be used to schedule jobs that  
could consume excessive computer resources and cause a DoS condition.  

Impact:  

If you assign the Deny log on as a batch job user right to other accounts, you could deny  
users who are assigned to specific administrative roles the ability to perform their required  
job activities. You should confirm that delegated tasks will not be affected adversely.  

For example, if you assign this user right to the IWAM_(ComputerName) account, the MSM  
Management Point will fail. On a newly installed computer that runs Windows Server 2003  
this account does not belong to the Guests group, but on a computer that was upgraded  
from Windows 2000 this account is a member of the Guests group. Therefore, it is  
important that you understand which accounts belong to any groups that you assign the  
Deny log on as a batch job user right.  

                                      

                                                                                                     113  | P a g e

2.2.23 (L1) Ensure 'Deny log on as a service' to include 'Guests'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This security setting determines which service accounts are prevented from registering a  
process as a service. This user right supersedes the Log on as a service user right if an  
account is subject to both policies.  

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Guests.  

Note: This security setting does not apply to the System, Local Service, or Network  
Service accounts.  

Rationale:  

Accounts that can log on as a service could be used to configure and start new  
unauthorized services, such as a keylogger or other malicious software. The benefit of the  
specified countermeasure is somewhat reduced by the fact that only users with  
administrative privileges can install and configure services, and an attacker who has  
already attained that level of access could configure the service to run with the System  
account.  

Impact:  

If you assign the Deny log on as a service user right to specific accounts, services may not  
be able to start and a DoS condition could result.

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller

Description:  

This security setting determines which users are prevented from logging on at the  
computer. This policy setting supersedes the Allow log on locally policy setting if an  
account is subject to both policies.  

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Guests.  

Important: If you apply this security policy to the Everyone group, no one will be able to  
log on locally.  

Rationale:  

Any account with the ability to log on locally could be used to log on at the console of the  
computer. If this user right is not restricted to legitimate users who need to log on to the  
console of the computer, unauthorized users might download and run malicious software  
that elevates their privileges.  

Impact:  

If you assign the Deny log on locally user right to additional accounts, you could limit the  
abilities of users who are assigned to specific roles in your environment. However, this user  
right should explicitly be assigned to the ASPNET account on computers that run IIS 6.0. You

2.2.25 (L1) Ensure 'Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services' to  
include 'Guests' (DC only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether users can log on as Remote Desktop clients. After  
the baseline Member Server is joined to a domain environment, there is no need to use  
local accounts to access the server from the network. Domain accounts can access the  
server for administration and end-user processing. This user right supersedes the Allow  
log on through Remote Desktop Services user right if an account is subject to both  
policies.  

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Guests.  

Caution: Configuring a standalone (non-domain-joined) server as described above may  
result in an inability to remotely administer the server.  

Note: The security identifier Local account is not available in Server 2008 R2 and Server  
2012 (non-R2) unless MSKB 2871997 has been installed.  

Note #2: In all versions of Windows Server prior to Server 2008 R2, Remote Desktop  
Services was known as Terminal Services, so you should substitute the older term if  
comparing against an older OS.  

Rationale:  

Any account with the right to log on through Remote Desktop Services could be used to log  
on to the remote console of the computer. If this user right is not restricted to legitimate  
users who need to log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users might

2.2.29 (L1) Ensure 'Force shutdown from a remote system' is set to  
'Administrators' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows users to shut down Windows Vista-based and newer computers  
from remote locations on the network. Anyone who has been assigned this user right can  
cause a denial of service (DoS) condition, which would make the computer unavailable to  
service user requests. Therefore, it is recommended that only highly trusted administrators  
be assigned this user right.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.  

Rationale:  

Any user who can shut down a computer could cause a DoS condition to occur. Therefore,  
this user right should be tightly restricted.  

Impact:  

If you remove the Force shutdown from a remote system user right from the Server  
Operators group you could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific  
administrative roles in your environment. You should confirm that delegated activities will  
not be adversely affected.

2.2.30 (L1) Ensure 'Generate security audits' is set to 'LOCAL SERVICE,  
NETWORK SERVICE' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines which users or processes can generate audit records in the  
Security log.  

The recommended state for this setting is: LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE.  

Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.  

Note #2: A Member Server that holds the  Web Server (IIS) Role with Web Server Role  
Service will require a special exception to this recommendation, to allow IIS application  
pool(s) to be granted this user right.  

Note #3: A Member Server that holds the Active Directory Federation Services Role will  
require a special exception to this recommendation, to allow the NT SERVICE\ADFSSrv and  
NT SERVICE\DRS services, as well as the associated Active Directory Federation Services  
service account, to be granted this user right.  

Rationale:  

An attacker could use this capability to create a large number of audited events, which  
would make it more difficult for a system administrator to locate any illicit activity. Also, if  
the event log is configured to overwrite events as needed, any evidence of unauthorized  
activities could be overwritten by a large number of unrelated events.  

Impact:  

On most computers, this is the default configuration and there will be no negative impact.  
However, if you have installed the Web Server (IIS) Role with Web Services Role Service, you  
will need to allow the IIS application pool(s) to be granted this user right.

2.2.31 (L1) Ensure 'Impersonate a client after authentication' is set to  
'Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE, SERVICE' (DC only)  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

Description:  

The policy setting allows programs that run on behalf of a user to impersonate that user (or  
another specified account) so that they can act on behalf of the user. If this user right is  
required for this kind of impersonation, an unauthorized user will not be able to convince a  
client to connect—for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes—to a  
service that they have created to impersonate that client, which could elevate the  
unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels.  

Services that are started by the Service Control Manager have the built-in Service group  
added by default to their access tokens. COM servers that are started by the COM  
infrastructure and configured to run under a specific account also have the Service group  
added to their access tokens. As a result, these processes are assigned this user right when  
they are started.  

Also, a user can impersonate an access token if any of the following conditions exist:  

        The access token that is being impersonated is for this user.  
        The user, in this logon session, logged on to the network with explicit credentials to  
         create the access token.  
        The requested level is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify.  

An attacker with the Impersonate a client after authentication user right could create a  
service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then impersonate that client  
to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of the client.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK  
SERVICE, SERVICE.  

Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.  

Note #2: A Member Server with Microsoft SQL Server and its optional "Integration  
Services" component installed will require a special exception to this recommendation for  
additional SQL-generated entries to be granted this user right.

2.2.34 (L1) Ensure 'Load and unload device drivers' is set to  
 'Administrators' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows users to dynamically load a new device driver on a system. An  
attacker could potentially use this capability to install malicious code that appears to be a  
device driver. This user right is required for users to add local printers or printer drivers in  
Windows Vista.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.  

Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.  

Rationale:  

Device drivers run as highly privileged code. A user who has the Load and unload device  
drivers user right could unintentionally install malicious code that masquerades as a  
device driver. Administrators should exercise greater care and install only drivers with  
verified digital signatures.  

Impact:  

If you remove the Load and unload device drivers user right from the Print Operators  
group or other accounts you could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific  
administrative roles in your environment. You should ensure that delegated tasks will not  
be negatively affected.

task scheduler is often used for administrative purposes, it may be needed in enterprise  
environments. However, its use should be restricted in high security environments to  
prevent misuse of system resources or to prevent attackers from using the right to launch  
malicious code after gaining user level access to a computer.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.  

Rationale:  

The Log on as a batch job user right presents a low-risk vulnerability. For most  
organizations, the default settings are sufficient.  

Impact:  

If you configure the Log on as a batch job setting through domain-based Group Policies,  
the computer will not be able to assign the user right to accounts that are used for  
scheduled jobs in the Task Scheduler. If you install optional components such as ASP.NET  
or IIS, you might need to assign this user right to additional accounts that are required by  
those components. For example, IIS requires assignment of this user right to the  IIS_WPG  
group and the IUSR_(ComputerName), ASPNET, and  IWAM_(ComputerName) accounts. If this  
user right is not assigned to this group and these accounts, IIS will be unable to run some  
COM objects that are necessary for proper functionality.

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

Description:  

This policy setting determines which users can change the auditing options for files and  
directories and clear the Security log.  

For environments running Microsoft Exchange Server, the Exchange Servers group must  
possess this privilege on Domain Controllers to properly function. Given this, DCs that  
grant the Exchange Servers group this privilege also conform to this benchmark. If the  
environment does not use Microsoft Exchange Server, then this privilege should be limited  
to only Administrators on DCs.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators and (when Exchange is running  
in the environment) Exchange Servers.  

Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.  

Rationale:  

The ability to manage the Security event log is a powerful user right and it should be closely  
guarded. Anyone with this user right can clear the Security log to erase important evidence  
of unauthorized activity.

2.2.42 (L1) Ensure 'Profile single process' is set to 'Administrators'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines which users can use tools to monitor the performance of  
non-system processes. Typically, you do not need to configure this user right to use the  
Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Performance snap-in. However, you do need this  
user right if System Monitor is configured to collect data using Windows Management  
Instrumentation (WMI). Restricting the Profile single process user right prevents  
intruders from gaining additional information that could be used to mount an attack on the  
system.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.  

Rationale:  

The Profile single process user right presents a moderate vulnerability. An attacker with  
this user right could monitor a computer's performance to help identify critical processes  
that they might wish to attack directly. The attacker may also be able to determine what  
processes run on the computer so that they could identify countermeasures that they may  
need to avoid, such as antivirus software, an intrusion-detection system, or which other  
users are logged on to a computer.

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows users to use tools to view the performance of different system

2.2.44 (L1) Ensure 'Replace a process level token' is set to 'LOCAL  
SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows one process or service to start another service or process with a  
different security access token, which can be used to modify the security access token of  
that sub-process and result in the escalation of privileges.  

The recommended state for this setting is: LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE.  

Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.  

Note #2: A Member Server that holds the  Web Server (IIS) Role with Web Server Role  
Service will require a special exception to this recommendation, to allow IIS application  
pool(s) to be granted this user right.  

Note #3: A Member Server with Microsoft SQL Server installed will require a special  
exception to this recommendation for additional SQL-generated entries to be granted this  
user right.  

Rationale:  

Users with the Replace a process level token privilege are able to start processes as other  
users whose credentials they know. They could use this method to hide their unauthorized  
actions on the computer. (On Windows 2000-based computers, use of the Replace a  
process level token user right also requires the user to have the Adjust memory quotas  
for a process user right that is discussed earlier in this section.)  

Impact:  

On most computers, this is the default configuration and there will be no negative impact.  
However, if you have installed the  Web Server (IIS) Role with Web Services Role Service, you  
will need to allow the IIS application pool(s) to be granted this User Right Assignment.

2.2.45 (L1) Ensure 'Restore files and directories' is set to 'Administrators'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines which users can bypass file, directory, registry, and other  
persistent object permissions when restoring backed up files and directories on computers  
that run Windows Vista (or newer) in your environment. This user right also determines  
which users can set valid security principals as object owners; it is similar to the Back up  
files and directories user right.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.  

Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.  

Rationale:  

An attacker with the Restore files and directories user right could restore sensitive data  
to a computer and overwrite data that is more recent, which could lead to loss of important  
data, data corruption, or a denial of service. Attackers could overwrite executable files that  
are used by legitimate administrators or system services with versions that include  
malicious software to grant themselves elevated privileges, compromise data, or install  
backdoors for continued access to the computer.  

Note: Even if the following countermeasure is configured, an attacker could still restore  
data to a computer in a domain that is controlled by the attacker. Therefore, it is critical  
that organizations carefully protect the media that is used to back up data.  

Impact:  

If you remove the Restore files and directories user right from the Backup Operators  
group and other accounts you could make it impossible for users who have been delegated  
specific tasks to perform those tasks. You should verify that this change won't negatively  
affect the ability of your organization's personnel to do their jobs.

2.2.46 (L1) Ensure 'Shut down the system' is set to 'Administrators'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines which users who are logged on locally to the computers in  
your environment can shut down the operating system with the Shut Down command.  
Misuse of this user right can result in a denial of service condition.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.  

Rationale:  

The ability to shut down Domain Controllers and Member Servers should be limited to a  
very small number of trusted Administrators. Although the Shut down the system user  
right requires the ability to log on to the server, you should be very careful about which  
accounts and groups you allow to shut down a Domain Controller or Member Server.  

When a Domain Controller is shut down, it is no longer available to process logons, serve  
Group Policy, and answer Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) queries. If you  
shut down Domain Controllers that possess Flexible Single Master Operations (FSMO)  
roles, you can disable key domain functionality, such as processing logons for new  
passwords — one of the functions of the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator role.  

Impact:  

The impact of removing these default groups from the Shut down the system user right  
could limit the delegated abilities of assigned roles in your environment. You should  
confirm that delegated activities will not be adversely affected.

2.2.47 (L1) Ensure 'Synchronize directory service data' is set to 'No One'  
(DC only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

Description:  

This security setting determines which users and groups have the authority to synchronize  
all directory service data. This is also known as Active Directory synchronization.  

The recommended state for this setting is: No One.  

Rationale:  

The Synchronize directory service data user right affects Domain Controllers; only  
Domain Controllers should be able to synchronize directory service data. Domain  
Controllers have this user right inherently, because the synchronization process runs in the  
context of the System account on Domain Controllers. Attackers who have this user right  
can view all information stored within the directory. They could then use some of that  
information to facilitate additional attacks or expose sensitive data, such as direct  
telephone numbers or physical addresses.

'Administrators' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows users to take ownership of files, folders, registry keys, processes,  
or threads. This user right bypasses any permissions that are in place to protect objects to  
give ownership to the specified user.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.  

Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.  

Rationale:  

Any users with the Take ownership of files or other objects user right can take control of  
any object, regardless of the permissions on that object, and then make any changes they  
wish to that object. Such changes could result in exposure of data, corruption of data, or a

2.3.1 Accounts  

This section contains recommendations related to default accounts.  

2.3.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Accounts: Administrator account status' is set to  
'Disabled' (MS only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting enables or disables the Administrator account during normal operation.  
When a computer is booted into safe mode, the Administrator account is always enabled,  
regardless of how this setting is configured. Note that this setting will have no impact when  
applied to the Domain Controllers organizational unit via group policy because Domain  
Controllers have no local account database. It can be configured at the domain level via  
group policy, similar to account lockout and password policy settings.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

In some organizations, it can be a daunting management challenge to maintain a regular  
schedule for periodic password changes for local accounts. Therefore, you may want to  
disable the built-in Administrator account instead of relying on regular password changes  
to protect it from attack. Another reason to disable this built-in account is that it cannot be  
locked out no matter how many failed logons it accrues, which makes it a prime target for  
brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. Also, this account has a well-known  
security identifier (SID) and there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using  
the SID rather than the account name. This capability means that even if you rename the  
Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by using the SID to log  
on.  

                                      

                                                                                                     164  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 166-----------------------

  

Impact:  

Maintenance issues can arise under certain circumstances if you disable the Administrator  
account. For example, if the secure channel between a member computer and the Domain  
Controller fails in a domain environment for any reason and there is no other local  
Administrator account, you must restart in safe mode to fix the problem that broke the  
secure channel.  

If the current Administrator password does not meet the password requirements, you will  
not be able to re-enable the Administrator account after it is disabled. If this situation  
occurs, another member of the Administrators group must set the password on the  
Administrator account with the Local Users and Groups tool.

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting prevents users from adding new Microsoft accounts on this computer.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Users can't add or log on with Microsoft  
accounts.  

Rationale:  

Organizations that want to effectively implement identity management policies and  
maintain firm control of what accounts are used to log onto their computers will probably  
want to block Microsoft accounts. Organizations may also need to block Microsoft accounts  
in order to meet the requirements of compliance standards that apply to their information

2.3.1.3 (L1) Ensure 'Accounts: Guest account status' is set to 'Disabled'  
(MS only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether the Guest account is enabled or disabled. The Guest  
account allows unauthenticated network users to gain access to the system.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Note: This setting will have no impact when applied to the Domain Controllers  
organizational unit via group policy because Domain Controllers have no local account  
database. It can be configured at the domain level via group policy, similar to account  
lockout and password policy settings.  

Rationale:  

The default Guest account allows unauthenticated network users to log on as Guest with no  
password. These unauthorized users could access any resources that are accessible to the  
Guest account over the network. This capability means that any network shares with  
permissions that allow access to the Guest account, the Guests group, or the Everyone  
group will be accessible over the network, which could lead to the exposure or corruption  
of data.  

Impact:  

All network users will need to authenticate before they can access shared resources. If you  
disable the Guest account and the Network Access: Sharing and Security Model option is set  
to Guest Only, network logons, such as those performed by the Microsoft Network Server  
(SMB Service), will fail. This policy setting should have little impact on most organizations  
because it is the default setting in Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows  
Server™ 2003.

2.3.1.4 (L1) Ensure 'Accounts: Limit local account use of blank  
passwords to console logon only' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether local accounts that are not password protected can  
be used to log on from locations other than the physical computer console. If you enable  
this policy setting, local accounts that have blank passwords will not be able to log on to the  
network from remote client computers. Such accounts will only be able to log on at the  
keyboard of the computer.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Blank passwords are a serious threat to computer security and should be forbidden  
through both organizational policy and suitable technical measures. In fact, the default  
settings for Active Directory domains require complex passwords of at least seven  
characters. However, if users with the ability to create new accounts bypass your domain- 
based password policies, they could create accounts with blank passwords. For example, a  
user could build a stand-alone computer, create one or more accounts with blank  
passwords, and then join the computer to the domain. The local accounts with blank  
passwords would still function. Anyone who knows the name of one of these unprotected  
accounts could then use it to log on.

2.3.1.5 (L1) Configure 'Accounts: Rename administrator account'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

The built-in local administrator account is a well-known account name that attackers will  
target. It is recommended to choose another name for this account, and to avoid names that  
denote administrative or elevated access accounts. Be sure to also change the default  
description for the local administrator (through the Computer Management console). On  
Domain Controllers, since they do not have their own local accounts, this rule refers to the  
built-in Administrator account that was established when the domain was first created.  

Rationale:  

The Administrator account exists on all computers that run the Windows 2000 or newer  
operating systems. If you rename this account, it is slightly more difficult for unauthorized  
persons to guess this privileged user name and password combination.  

The built-in Administrator account cannot be locked out, regardless of how many times an  
attacker might use a bad password. This capability makes the Administrator account a  
popular target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. The value of this  
countermeasure is lessened because this account has a well-known SID, and there are  
third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID rather than the account name.  
Therefore, even if you rename the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute  
force attack by using the SID to log on.  

Impact:  

You will have to inform users who are authorized to use this account of the new account  
name. (The guidance for this setting assumes that the Administrator account was not  
disabled, which was recommended earlier in this chapter.)

Description:  

The built-in local guest account is another well-known name to attackers. It is  
recommended to rename this account to something that does not indicate its purpose. Even  
if you disable this account, which is recommended, ensure that you rename it for added

2.3.2 Audit  

This section contains recommendations related to auditing controls.  

2.3.2.1 (L1) Ensure 'Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings  
(Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings' is set  
to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows administrators to enable the more precise auditing capabilities  
present in Windows Vista.  

The Audit Policy settings available in Windows Server 2003 Active Directory do not yet  
contain settings for managing the new auditing subcategories. To properly apply the  
auditing policies prescribed in this baseline, the Audit: Force audit policy subcategory  
settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings setting needs to  
be configured to Enabled.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Important: Be very cautious about audit settings that can generate a large volume of  
traffic. For example, if you enable either success or failure auditing for all of the Privilege  
Use subcategories, the high volume of audit events generated can make it difficult to find  
other types of entries in the Security log. Such a configuration could also have a significant  
impact on system performance.  

Rationale:  

Prior to the introduction of auditing subcategories in Windows Vista, it was difficult to  
track events at a per-system or per-user level. The larger event categories created too  
many events and the key information that needed to be audited was difficult to find.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

2.3.2.2 (L1) Ensure 'Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to  
log security audits' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether the system shuts down if it is unable to log Security  
events. It is a requirement for Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)-C2  
and Common Criteria certification to prevent auditable events from occurring if the audit  
system is unable to log them. Microsoft has chosen to meet this requirement by halting the  
system and displaying a stop message if the auditing system experiences a failure. When  
this policy setting is enabled, the system will be shut down if a security audit cannot be  
logged for any reason.  

If the Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits setting is  
enabled, unplanned system failures can occur. The administrative burden can be  
significant, especially if you also configure the Retention method for the Security log to Do  
not overwrite events (clear log manually). This configuration causes a repudiation threat (a  
backup operator could deny that they backed up or restored data) to become a denial of  
service (DoS) vulnerability, because a server could be forced to shut down if it is  
overwhelmed with logon events and other security events that are written to the Security  
log. Also, because the shutdown is not graceful, it is possible that irreparable damage to the  
operating system, applications, or data could result. Although the NTFS file system  
guarantees its integrity when an ungraceful computer shutdown occurs, it cannot  
guarantee that every data file for every application will still be in a usable form when the  
computer restarts.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

If the computer is unable to record events to the Security log, critical evidence or important  
troubleshooting information may not be available for review after a security incident. Also,  
an attacker could potentially generate a large volume of Security log events to purposely  
force a computer shutdown.

media' is set to 'Administrators' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines who is allowed to format and eject removable NTFS media.  
You can use this policy setting to prevent unauthorized users from removing data on one  
computer to access it on another computer on which they have local administrator  
privileges.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.  

Rationale:  

Users may be able to move data on removable disks to a different computer where they  
have administrative privileges. The user could then take ownership of any file, grant  
themselves full control, and view or modify any file. The fact that most removable storage  
devices will eject media by pressing a mechanical button diminishes the advantage of this  
policy setting.

2.3.4.2 (L1) Ensure 'Devices: Prevent users from installing printer drivers'  
is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

For a computer to print to a shared printer, the driver for that shared printer must be  
installed on the local computer. This security setting determines who is allowed to install a  
printer driver as part of connecting to a shared printer.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Note: This setting does not affect the ability to add a local printer. This setting does not  
affect Administrators.  

Rationale:  

It may be appropriate in some organizations to allow users to install printer drivers on  
their own workstations. However, you should allow only Administrators, not users, to do so  
on servers, because printer driver installation on a server may unintentionally cause the  
computer to become less stable. A malicious user could install inappropriate printer  
drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage the computer, or a user might accidentally install  
malicious software that masquerades as a printer driver. It is feasible for an attacker to  
disguise a Trojan horse program as a printer driver. The program may appear to users as if  
they must use it to print, but such a program could unleash malicious code on your  
computer network.

2.3.5 Domain controller  

This section contains recommendations related to Domain Controllers.  

2.3.5.1 (L1) Ensure 'Domain controller: Allow server operators to  
schedule tasks' is set to 'Disabled' (DC only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether members of the Server Operators group are  
allowed to submit jobs by means of the AT schedule facility. The impact of this policy  
setting configuration should be small for most organizations. Users, including those in the  
Server Operators group, will still be able to create jobs by means of the Task Scheduler  
Wizard, but those jobs will run in the context of the account with which the user  
authenticates when they set up the job.  

Note: An AT Service Account can be modified to select a different account rather than the  
LOCAL SYSTEM account. To change the account, open System Tools, click Scheduled Tasks,  
and then click Accessories folder. Then click AT Service Account on the Advanced menu.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

If you enable this policy setting, jobs that are created by server operators by means of the  
AT service will execute in the context of the account that runs that service. By default, that  
is the local SYSTEM account. If you enable this policy setting, server operators could  
perform tasks that SYSTEM is able to do but that they would typically not be able to do,  
such as add their account to the local Administrators group.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior. Note that users (including those in the Server Operators  
group) are still able to create jobs by means of the Task Scheduler Wizard. However, those  
jobs will run in the context of the account that the user authenticates with when setting up  
the job.

2.3.5.2 (L1) Ensure 'Domain controller: Allow vulnerable Netlogon  
secure channel connections' is set to 'Not Configured' (DC Only)  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

Description:  

This security setting determines whether the domain controller bypasses secure RPC for  
Netlogon secure channel connections for specified machine accounts.  

When deployed, this policy should be applied to all domain controllers in a forest by  
enabling the policy on the domain controllers OU.  

When the Create Vulnerable Connections list (allow list) is configured:  

        Given allow permission, the domain controller will allow accounts to use a Netlogon  
         secure channel without secure RPC.  
        Given deny permission, the domain controller will require accounts to use a  
         Netlogon secure channel with secure RPC which is the same as the default (not  
         necessary).  

Note: Warning from Microsoft - enabling this policy will expose your domain-joined  
devices and can expose your Active Directory forest to risk. This policy should be used as a  
temporary measure for 3rd-party devices as you deploy updates. Once a 3rd-party device is  
updated to support using secure RPC with Netlogon secure channels, the account should be  
removed from the Create Vulnerable Connections list. To better understand the risk of  
configuring accounts to be allowed to use vulnerable Netlogon secure channel connections,  
please visit How to manage the changes in Netlogon secure channel connections associated  
with CVE-2020-1472.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Not Configured.  

Rationale:  

Enabling this policy will expose your domain-joined devices and can expose your Active  
Directory forest to security risks. It is highly recommended that this setting not be used (i.e.  
be left completely unconfigured) so as not to add risk.

2.3.5.3 (L1) Ensure 'Domain controller: LDAP server channel binding  
token requirements' is set to 'Always' (DC Only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

Description:  

This setting determines whether the LDAP server (Domain Controller) enforces validation  
of Channel Binding Tokens (CBT) received in LDAP bind requests that are sent over  
SSL/TLS (i.e. LDAPS).  

The recommended state for this setting is: Always.  

Note: All LDAP clients must have the CVC-2017-8563 security update to be compatible  
with Domain Controllers that have this setting enabled. More information on this setting is  
available at: MSKB 4520412: 2020 LDAP channel binding and LDAP signing requirements  
for Windows  

Rationale:  

Requiring Channel Binding Tokens (CBT) can prevent an attacker who is able to capture  
users' authentication credentials (e.g. OAuth tokens, session identifiers, etc.) from reusing  
those credentials in another TLS session. This also helps to increase protection against  
"man-in-the-middle" attacks using LDAP authentication over SSL/TLS (LDAPS).  

                                       

                                                                                                        189  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 191-----------------------

  

Impact:  

All LDAP clients must provide channel binding information over SSL/TLS (i.e. LDAPS). The  
LDAP server (Domain Controller) rejects authentication requests from clients that do not  
do so. Clients must have the CVC-2017-8563 security update to support this feature, and  
may have compatibility issues with this setting without the security update. This may also  
mean that LDAP authentication requests over SSL/TLS that previously worked may stop  
working until the security update is installed.  

When first deploying this setting, you may initially want to only set it to the alternate  
setting of When supported  (instead of Always) on all Domain Controllers. This alternate,  
interim setting enables support for LDAP client channel binding but does not require it.  
Then set one DC that is not currently being targeted by LDAP clients to Always, and test  
each of the critical LDAP clients against that DC (and remediating as necessary), before  
deploying Always to the rest of the DCs.  

We also recommend using the new Event ID 3039 on your Domain Controllers (added with  
the March 2020 security update) to help locate clients that do not use Channel Binding  
Tokens (CBT) in their LDAPS connections. This new Event ID requires increasing the  
logging level of the 16 LDAP Interface Events portion of the NTDS service diagnostics to  
a value of 2  (Basic). For more information, please see Table 2: CBT events at this link: MSKB  
4520412: 2020 LDAP channel binding and LDAP signing requirements for Windows  

Older OSes such as Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista and Windows  
Server 2008 (non-R2), will first require patches for Microsoft Security Advisory 973811, as  
well as all associated fixes, in order to be compatible with domain controllers that have this  
setting deployed.  

Note: Only Always is actually considered compliant to the CIS benchmark.

2.3.5.4 (L1) Ensure 'Domain controller: LDAP server signing  
requirements' is set to 'Require signing' (DC only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)  
server requires LDAP clients to negotiate data signing.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Require signing.  

Note: Domain member computers must have Network security: LDAP signing requirements  
(Rule 2.3.11.8) set to Negotiate signing or higher. If not, they will fail to authenticate  
once the above Require signing value is configured on the Domain Controllers.  
Fortunately, Negotiate signing is the default in the client configuration.  

Note #2: This policy setting does not have any impact on LDAP simple bind  
(ldap_simple_bind) or LDAP simple bind through SSL (ldap_simple_bind_s). No  
Microsoft LDAP clients that are shipped with Windows XP Professional use LDAP simple  
bind or LDAP simple bind through SSL to talk to a Domain Controller.  

Note #3: Before enabling this setting, you should first ensure that there are no clients  
(including server-based applications) that are configured to authenticate with Active  
Directory via unsigned LDAP, because changing this setting will break those applications.  
Such applications should first be reconfigured to use signed LDAP, Secure LDAP (LDAPS),  
or IPsec-protected connections. For more information on how to identify whether your DCs  
are being accessed via unsigned LDAP (and where those accesses are coming from), see  
this Microsoft TechNet blog article: Identifying Clear Text LDAP binds to your DC’s –  
Practical Windows Security  

                                      

                                                                                                     192  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 194-----------------------

  

Rationale:  

Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. In such attacks, an  
intruder captures packets between the server and the client, modifies them, and then  
forwards them to the client. Where LDAP servers are concerned, an attacker could cause a  
client to make decisions that are based on false records from the LDAP directory. To lower  
the risk of such an intrusion in an organization's network, you can implement strong  
physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you could  
implement Internet Protocol security (IPsec) authentication header mode (AH), which  
performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for IP traffic to make all types of man- 
in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult.  

Additionally, allowing the use of regular, unsigned LDAP permits credentials to be received  
over the network in clear text, which could very easily result in the interception of account  
passwords by other systems on the network.  

Impact:  

Unless TLS/SSL is being used, the LDAP data signing option must be negotiated. Clients that  
do not support LDAP signing will be unable to run LDAP queries against the Domain  
Controllers. All Windows 2000-based computers in your organization that are managed  
from Windows Server 2003-based or Windows XP-based computers and that use Windows  
NT Challenge/Response (NTLM) authentication must have Windows 2000 Service Pack 3  
(SP3) installed. Alternatively, these clients must have a registry change. For information  
about this registry change, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 325465: Windows 2000  
domain controllers require SP3 or later when using Windows Server 2003 administration  
tools. Also, some non-Microsoft operating systems do not support LDAP signing. If you  
enable this policy setting, client computers that use those operating systems may be unable  
to access domain resources.

2.3.5.5 (L1) Ensure  'Domain controller: Refuse machine account  
password changes' is set to 'Disabled' (DC only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

Description:  

This security setting determines whether Domain Controllers will refuse requests from  
member computers to change computer account passwords.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Note: Some problems can occur as a result of machine account password expiration,  
particularly if a machine is reverted to a previous point-in-time state, as is common with  
virtual machines. Depending on how far back the reversion is, the older machine account  
password stored on the machine may no longer be recognized by the domain controllers,  
and therefore the computer loses its domain trust. This can also disrupt non-persistent VDI  
implementations, and devices with write filters that disallow permanent changes to the OS  
volume. Some organizations may choose to exempt themselves from this recommendation  
and disable machine account password expiration for these situations.  

Rationale:  

If you enable this policy setting on all Domain Controllers in a domain, domain members  
will not be able to change their computer account passwords, and those passwords will be  
more susceptible to attack.

2.3.6 Domain member  

This section contains recommendations related to domain membership.  

2.3.6.1 (L1) Ensure 'Domain member: Digitally encrypt or sign secure  
channel data (always)' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether all secure channel traffic that is initiated by the  
domain member must be signed or encrypted.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created. After it joins the domain,  
the computer uses the password for that account to create a secure channel with the  
Domain Controller for its domain every time that it restarts. Requests that are sent on the  
secure channel are authenticated—and sensitive information such as passwords are  
encrypted—but the channel is not integrity-checked, and not all information is encrypted.  

Digital encryption and signing of the secure channel is a good idea where it is supported.  
The secure channel protects domain credentials as they are sent to the Domain Controller.  

                                      

                                                                                                      197  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 199-----------------------

  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior. However, only Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 6a  
(SP6a) and subsequent versions of the Windows operating system support digital  
encryption and signing of the secure channel. Windows 98 Second Edition clients do not  
support it unless they have Dsclient installed. Therefore, you cannot enable the Domain  
member: Digitally encrypt or sign secure channel data (always) setting on Domain  
Controllers that support Windows 98 clients as members of the domain. Potential impacts  
can include the following:  

        The ability to create or delete trust relationships with clients running versions of  
         Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will be disabled.  
        Logons from clients running versions of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with  
         SP6a will be disabled.  
        The ability to authenticate other domains' users from a Domain Controller running a  
         version of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a in a trusted domain will  
         be disabled.  

You can enable this policy setting after you eliminate all Windows 9x clients from the  
domain and upgrade all Windows NT 4.0 servers and Domain Controllers from  
trusted/trusting domains to Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a.

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether a domain member should attempt to negotiate  
whether all secure channel traffic that it initiates must be digitally signed. Digital signatures  
protect the traffic from being modified by anyone who captures the data as it traverses the

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created. After it joins the domain,  
the computer uses the password for that account to create a secure channel with the

2.3.6.4 (L1) Ensure 'Domain member: Disable machine account  
password changes' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether a domain member can periodically change its  
computer account password. Computers that cannot automatically change their account  
passwords are potentially vulnerable, because an attacker might be able to determine the  
password for the system's domain account.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Note: Some problems can occur as a result of machine account password expiration,  
particularly if a machine is reverted to a previous point-in-time state, as is common with  
virtual machines. Depending on how far back the reversion is, the older machine account  
password stored on the machine may no longer be recognized by the domain controllers,  
and therefore the computer loses its domain trust. This can also disrupt non-persistent VDI  
implementations, and devices with write filters that disallow permanent changes to the OS  
volume. Some organizations may choose to exempt themselves from this recommendation  
and disable machine account password expiration for these situations.  

Rationale:  

The default configuration for Windows Server 2003-based computers that belong to a  
domain is that they are automatically required to change the passwords for their accounts  
every 30 days. If you disable this policy setting, computers that run Windows Server 2003  
will retain the same passwords as their computer accounts. Computers that are no longer  
able to automatically change their account password are at risk from an attacker who could  
determine the password for the computer's domain account.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

2.3.6.5 (L1) Ensure 'Domain member: Maximum machine account  
password age' is set to '30 or fewer days, but not 0' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines the maximum allowable age for a computer account  
password. By default, domain members automatically change their domain passwords  
every 30 days.  

The recommended state for this setting is: 30 or fewer days, but not 0.  

Note: A value of  0 does not conform to the benchmark as it disables maximum password  
age.  

Note #2: Some problems can occur as a result of machine account password expiration,  
particularly if a machine is reverted to a previous point-in-time state, as is common with  
virtual machines. Depending on how far back the reversion is, the older machine account  
password stored on the machine may no longer be recognized by the domain controllers,  
and therefore the computer loses its domain trust. This can also disrupt non-persistent VDI  
implementations, and devices with write filters that disallow permanent changes to the OS  
volume. Some organizations may choose to exempt themselves from this recommendation  
and disable machine account password expiration for these situations.  

Rationale:  

In Active Directory-based domains, each computer has an account and password just like  
every user. By default, the domain members automatically change their domain password  
every 30 days. If you increase this interval significantly, or set it to 0 so that the computers  
no longer change their passwords, an attacker will have more time to undertake a brute  
force attack to guess the passwords of computer accounts.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

2.3.6.6 (L1) Ensure 'Domain member: Require strong (Windows 2000 or  
later) session key' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

When this policy setting is enabled, a secure channel can only be established with Domain  
Controllers that are capable of encrypting secure channel data with a strong (128-bit)  
session key.  

To enable this policy setting, all Domain Controllers in the domain must be able to encrypt  
secure channel data with a strong key, which means all Domain Controllers must be  
running Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Session keys that are used to establish secure channel communications between Domain  
Controllers and member computers are much stronger in Windows 2000 than they were in  
previous Microsoft operating systems. Whenever possible, you should take advantage of  
these stronger session keys to help protect secure channel communications from attacks  
that attempt to hijack network sessions and eavesdropping. (Eavesdropping is a form of  
hacking in which network data is read or altered in transit. The data can be modified to  
hide or change the sender, or be redirected.)  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior. However, computers will not be able to join Windows  
NT 4.0 domains, and trusts between Active Directory domains and Windows NT-style  
domains may not work properly. Also, Domain Controllers with this setting configured will  
not allow older pre-Windows 2000 clients (that that do not support this policy setting) to  
join the domain.

2.3.7.1 (L1) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Do not require CTRL+ALT+DEL' is  
set to 'Disabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether users must press CTRL+ALT+DEL before they log  
on.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

Microsoft developed this feature to make it easier for users with certain types of physical  
impairments to log on to computers that run Windows. If users are not required to press  
CTRL+ALT+DEL, they are susceptible to attacks that attempt to intercept their passwords.  
If CTRL+ALT+DEL is required before logon, user passwords are communicated by means of  
a trusted path.  

An attacker could install a Trojan horse program that looks like the standard Windows  
logon dialog box and capture the user's password. The attacker would then be able to log  
on to the compromised account with whatever level of privilege that user has.  

Impact:  

Users must press CTRL+ALT+DEL before they log on to Windows unless they use a smart  
card for Windows logon. A smart card is a tamper-proof device that stores security  
information.

2.3.7.2 (L1) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Don't display last signed-in' is set  
to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether the account name of the last user to log on to the  
client computers in your organization will be displayed in each computer's respective  
Windows logon screen. Enable this policy setting to prevent intruders from collecting  
account names visually from the screens of desktop or laptop computers in your  
organization.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

An attacker with access to the console (for example, someone with physical access or  
someone who is able to connect to the server through Remote Desktop Services) could  
view the name of the last user who logged on to the server. The attacker could then try to  
guess the password, use a dictionary, or use a brute-force attack to try and log on.  

Impact:  

The name of the last user to successfully log on will not be displayed in the Windows logon  
screen.

2.3.7.3 (L1) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Machine inactivity limit' is set to  
'900 or fewer second(s), but not 0' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

Windows notices inactivity of a logon session, and if the amount of inactive time exceeds  
the inactivity limit, then the screen saver will run, locking the session.  

The recommended state for this setting is:  900 or fewer second(s), but not 0.  

Note: A value of  0 does not conform to the benchmark as it disables the machine inactivity  
limit.  

Rationale:  

If a user forgets to lock their computer when they walk away it's possible that a passerby  
will hijack it.  

Impact:  

The screen saver will automatically activate when the computer has been unattended for  
the amount of time specified. The impact should be minimal since the screen saver is  
enabled by default.

2.3.7.4 (L1) Configure 'Interactive logon: Message text for users  
attempting to log on' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting specifies a text message that displays to users when they log on.  
Configure this setting in a manner that is consistent with the security and operational  
requirements of your organization.  

Rationale:  

Displaying a warning message before logon may help prevent an attack by warning the  
attacker about the consequences of their misconduct before it happens. It may also help to  
reinforce corporate policy by notifying employees of the appropriate policy during the  
logon process. This text is often used for legal reasons—for example, to warn users about  
the ramifications of misusing company information or to warn them that their actions may  
be audited.  

Note: Any warning that you display should first be approved by your organization's legal  
and human resources representatives.  

Impact:  

Users will have to acknowledge a dialog box containing the configured text before they can  
log on to the computer.  

Note: Windows Vista and Windows XP Professional support logon banners that can exceed  
512 characters in length and that can also contain carriage-return line-feed sequences.  
However, Windows 2000-based clients cannot interpret and display these messages. You  
must use a Windows 2000-based computer to create a logon message policy that applies to  
Windows 2000-based computers.

2.3.7.6 (L2) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to  
cache (in case domain controller is not available)' is set to '4 or fewer  
logon(s)' (MS only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether a user can log on to a Windows domain using  
cached account information. Logon information for domain accounts can be cached locally  
to allow users to log on even if a Domain Controller cannot be contacted. This policy setting  
determines the number of unique users for whom logon information is cached locally. If  
this value is set to 0, the logon cache feature is disabled. An attacker who is able to access  
the file system of the server could locate this cached information and use a brute force  
attack to determine user passwords.  

The recommended state for this setting is: 4 or fewer logon(s).  

Rationale:  

The number that is assigned to this policy setting indicates the number of users whose  
logon information the computer will cache locally. If the number is set to 4, then the  
computer caches logon information for 4 users. When a 5th user logs on to the computer,  
the server overwrites the oldest cached logon session.  

Users who access the computer console will have their logon credentials cached on that  
computer. An attacker who is able to access the file system of the computer could locate  
this cached information and use a brute force attack to attempt to determine user  
passwords. To mitigate this type of attack, Windows encrypts the information and obscures  
its physical location.  

Impact:  

Users will be unable to log on to any computers if there is no Domain Controller available  
to authenticate them. Organizations may want to configure this value to 2 for end-user  
computers, especially for mobile users. A configuration value of 2 means that the user's  
logon information will still be in the cache, even if a member of the IT department has  
recently logged on to their computer to perform system maintenance. This method allows  
users to log on to their computers when they are not connected to the organization's  
network.

2.3.7.7 (L1) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Prompt user to change password  
before expiration' is set to 'between 5 and 14 days' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines how far in advance users are warned that their password  
will expire. It is recommended that you configure this policy setting to at least 5 days but  
no more than 14 days to sufficiently warn users when their passwords will expire.  

The recommended state for this setting is: between 5 and 14 days.  

Rationale:  

It is recommended that user passwords be configured to expire periodically. Users will  
need to be warned that their passwords are going to expire, or they may inadvertently be  
locked out of the computer when their passwords expire. This condition could lead to  
confusion for users who access the network locally, or make it impossible for users to  
access your organization's network through dial-up or virtual private network (VPN)  
connections.  

Impact:  

Users will see a dialog box prompt to change their password each time that they log on to

2.3.7.8 (L1) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Require Domain Controller  
A uthentication to unlock workstation' is set to 'Enabled' (MS only)  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

Logon information is required to unlock a locked computer. For domain accounts, this  
security setting determines whether it is necessary to contact a Domain Controller to  
unlock a computer.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

By default, the computer caches in memory the credentials of any users who are  
authenticated locally. The computer uses these cached credentials to authenticate anyone  
who attempts to unlock the console. When cached credentials are used, any changes that  
have recently been made to the account — such as user rights assignments, account  
lockout, or the account being disabled — are not considered or applied after the account is  
authenticated. User privileges are not updated, and (more importantly) disabled accounts  
are still able to unlock the console of the computer.  

Impact:  

When the console on a computer is locked, either by a user or automatically by a screen  
saver time-out, the console can only be unlocked if a Domain Controller is available to re- 
authenticate the domain account that is being used to unlock the computer. If no Domain  
Controller is available, the user cannot unlock the computer.

2.3.7.9 (L1) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Smart card removal behavior' is  
set to 'Lock Workstation' or higher (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines what happens when the smart card for a logged-on user is  
removed from the smart card reader.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Lock Workstation. Configuring this setting to  
Force Logoff or Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session also conforms to  
the benchmark.  

Rationale:  

Users sometimes forget to lock their workstations when they are away from them, allowing  
the possibility for malicious users to access their computers. If smart cards are used for  
authentication, the computer should automatically lock itself when the card is removed to  
ensure that only the user with the smart card is accessing resources using those  
credentials.  

                                       

                                                                                                         226  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 228-----------------------

  

Impact:  

If you select Lock Workstation, the workstation is locked when the smart card is removed,  
allowing users to leave the area, take their smart card with them, and still maintain a  
protected session.  

If you select Force Logoff, users are automatically logged off when their smart card is  
removed.  

If you select Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session, removal of the smart  
card disconnects the session without logging the users off. This allows the user to insert the  
smart card and resume the session later, or at another smart card reader-equipped  
computer, without having to log on again. If the session is local, this policy will function  
identically to Lock Workstation.  

Enforcing this setting on computers used by people who must log onto multiple computers  
in order to perform their duties could be frustrating and lower productivity. For example, if  
network administrators are limited to a single account but need to log into several  
computers simultaneously in order to effectively manage the network enforcing this setting  
will limit them to logging onto one computer at a time. For these reasons it is  
recommended that this setting only be enforced on workstations used for purposes  
commonly associated with typical users such as document creation and email.  

Audit:  

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as  
prescribed, noting that values of Force Logoff or Disconnect if a Remote Desktop  
Services session are also acceptable settings. This group policy setting is backed by the

2.3.8 Microsoft network client  

This section contains recommendations related to configuring the Microsoft network client.  

2.3.8.1 (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network client: Digitally sign  
communications (always)' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB client  
component.  

Note: When Windows Vista-based computers have this policy setting enabled and they  
connect to file or print shares on remote servers, it is important that the setting is  
synchronized with its companion setting, Microsoft network server: Digitally sign  
communications (always), on those servers. For more information about these settings,  
see the "Microsoft network client and server: Digitally sign communications (four related  
settings)" section in Chapter 5 of the Threats and Countermeasures guide.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as  
the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can  
potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and  
forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker  
could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized  
access to data.  

SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating  
systems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures authenticate  
both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process,  
data transmission will not take place.  

                                      

                                                                                                     229  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 231-----------------------

  

Impact:  

The Microsoft network client will not communicate with a Microsoft network server unless  
that server agrees to perform SMB packet signing.  

The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows  
XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print sharing  
protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking attacks and  
supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing  
provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then  
verified by both the client and the server.  

Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet  
needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing  
multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a Domain Controller, file  
server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed.  
Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older  
applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely  
disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks.  

When SMB signing policies are enabled on Domain Controllers running Windows Server  
2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group  
policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from Microsoft that resolves this issue; see  
Microsoft Knowledge Base article 950876 for more details: Group Policy settings are not  
applied on member computers that are running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista  
SP1 when certain SMB signing policies are enabled.

2.3.8.3 (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network client: Send unencrypted  
password to third-party SMB servers' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether the SMB redirector will send plaintext passwords  
during authentication to third-party SMB servers that do not support password encryption.  

It is recommended that you disable this policy setting unless there is a strong business case  
to enable it. If this policy setting is enabled, unencrypted passwords will be allowed across  
the network.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

If you enable this policy setting, the server can transmit passwords in plaintext across the  
network to other computers that offer SMB services, which is a significant security risk.  
These other computers may not use any of the SMB security mechanisms that are included  
with Windows Server 2003.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.  

Some very old applications and operating systems such as MS-DOS, Windows for

2.3.9 Microsoft network server  

This section contains recommendations related to configuring the Microsoft network  
server.  

2.3.9.1 (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network server: Amount of idle time  
required before suspending session' is set to '15 or fewer minute(s)'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to specify the amount of continuous idle time that must pass  
in an SMB session before the session is suspended because of inactivity. Administrators can  
use this policy setting to control when a computer suspends an inactive SMB session. If  
client activity resumes, the session is automatically reestablished.  

The maximum value is 99999, which is over 69 days; in effect, this value disables the  
setting.  

The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or fewer minute(s).  

Rationale:  

Each SMB session consumes server resources, and numerous null sessions will slow the  
server or possibly cause it to fail. An attacker could repeatedly establish SMB sessions until  
the server's SMB services become slow or unresponsive.  

Impact:  

There will be little impact because SMB sessions will be re-established automatically if the  
client resumes activity.

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB server  
component. Enable this policy setting in a mixed environment to prevent downstream  
clients from using the workstation as a network server.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as  
the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can  
potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and  
forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker  
could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized  
access to data.  

SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating  
systems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures authenticate  
both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process,  
data transmission will not take place.

Impact:  

The Microsoft network server will not communicate with a Microsoft network client unless  
that client agrees to perform SMB packet signing.  

The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows  
XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print sharing  
protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking attacks and  
supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing  
provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then  
verified by both the client and the server.  

Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet  
needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing  
multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a Domain Controller, file  
server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed.  
Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older  
applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely  
disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks.  

When SMB signing policies are enabled on Domain Controllers running Windows Server  
2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group  
policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from Microsoft that resolves this issue; see  
Microsoft Knowledge Base article 950876 for more details: Group Policy settings are not  
applied on member computers that are running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether the SMB server will negotiate SMB packet signing  
with clients that request it. If no signing request comes from the client, a connection will be  
allowed without a signature if the Microsoft network server: Digitally sign  
communications (always) setting is not enabled.  

Note: Enable this policy setting on SMB clients on your network to make them fully  
effective for packet signing with all clients and servers in your environment.

2.3.9.4 (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network server: Disconnect clients when  
logon hours expire' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This security setting determines whether to disconnect users who are connected to the  
local computer outside their user account's valid logon hours. This setting affects the  
Server Message Block (SMB) component. If you enable this policy setting you should also  
enable Network security: Force logoff when logon hours expire  (Rule 2.3.11.6).  

If your organization configures logon hours for users, this policy setting is necessary to  
ensure they are effective.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

If your organization configures logon hours for users, then it makes sense to enable this  
policy setting. Otherwise, users who should not have access to network resources outside  
of their logon hours may actually be able to continue to use those resources with sessions  
that were established during allowed hours.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior. If logon hours are not used in your organization, this  
policy setting will have no impact. If logon hours are used, existing user sessions will be  
forcibly terminated when their logon hours expire.

2.3.9.5 (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network server: Server SPN target name  
validation level' is set to 'Accept if provided by client' or higher (MS only)  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting controls the level of validation a computer with shared folders or  
printers (the server) performs on the service principal name (SPN) that is provided by the  
client computer when it establishes a session using the server message block (SMB)  
protocol.  

The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for file and print sharing and  
other networking operations, such as remote Windows administration. The SMB protocol  
supports validating the SMB server service principal name (SPN) within the authentication  
blob provided by a SMB client to prevent a class of attacks against SMB servers referred to  
as SMB relay attacks. This setting will affect both SMB1 and SMB2.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Accept if provided by client. Configuring  
this setting to Required from client also conforms to the benchmark.  

Note: Since the release of the MS KB3161561 security patch, this setting can cause  
significant issues (such as replication problems, group policy editing issues and blue screen  
crashes) on Domain Controllers when used simultaneously with UNC path hardening (i.e.  
Rule 18.5.14.1). CIS therefore recommends against deploying this setting on Domain  
Controllers.  

Rationale:  

The identity of a computer can be spoofed to gain unauthorized access to network  
resources.

----------------------- Page 249-----------------------

  

Impact:  

All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a server- 
side SMB component. This setting affects the server SMB behavior, and its implementation  
should be carefully evaluated and tested to prevent disruptions to file and print serving  
capabilities.  

If configured to Accept if provided by client, the SMB server will accept and validate  
the SPN provided by the SMB client and allow a session to be established if it matches the  
SMB server’s list of SPN’s for itself. If the SPN does NOT match, the session request for that  
SMB client will be denied.  

If configured to Required from client, the SMB client MUST send a SPN name in session  
setup, and the SPN name provided MUST match the SMB server that is being requested to  
establish a connection. If no SPN is provided by client, or the SPN provided does not match,  
the session is denied.

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting controls the ability of anonymous users to enumerate the accounts in  
the Security Accounts Manager (SAM). If you enable this policy setting, users with  
anonymous connections will not be able to enumerate domain account user names on the  
systems in your environment. This policy setting also allows additional restrictions on  
anonymous connections.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Note: This policy has no effect on Domain Controllers.  

Rationale:  

An unauthorized user could anonymously list account names and use the information to  
attempt to guess passwords or perform social engineering attacks. (Social engineering  
attacks try to deceive users in some way to obtain passwords or some form of security  
information.)  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior. It will be impossible to establish trusts with Windows  
NT 4.0-based domains. Also, client computers that run older versions of the Windows

2.3.10.3 (L1) Ensure  'Network access: Do not allow anonymous  
enumeration of SAM accounts and shares' is set to 'Enabled' (MS only)  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting controls the ability of anonymous users to enumerate SAM accounts as  
well as shares. If you enable this policy setting, anonymous users will not be able to  
enumerate domain account user names and network share names on the systems in your  
environment.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Note: This policy has no effect on Domain Controllers.  

Rationale:  

An unauthorized user could anonymously list account names and shared resources and use  
the information to attempt to guess passwords or perform social engineering attacks.  
(Social engineering attacks try to deceive users in some way to obtain passwords or some  
form of security information.)  

Impact:  

It will be impossible to establish trusts with Windows NT 4.0-based domains. Also, client  
computers that run older versions of the Windows operating system such as Windows NT  
3.51 and Windows 95 will experience problems when they try to use resources on the  
server. Users who access file and print servers anonymously will be unable to list the  
shared network resources on those servers; the users will have to authenticate before they  
can view the lists of shared folders and printers. However, even with this policy setting  
enabled, anonymous users will have access to resources with permissions that explicitly  
include the built-in group, ANONYMOUS LOGON.

2.3.10.4 (L2) Ensure 'Network access: Do not allow storage of  
passwords and credentials for network authentication' is set to  
'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether Credential Manager (formerly called Stored User  
Names and Passwords) saves passwords or credentials for later use when it gains domain  
authentication.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Note: Changes to this setting will not take effect until Windows is restarted.  

Rationale:  

Passwords that are cached can be accessed by the user when logged on to the computer.  
Although this information may sound obvious, a problem can arise if the user unknowingly  
executes hostile code that reads the passwords and forwards them to another,  
unauthorized user.  

Impact:  

Credential Manager will not store passwords and credentials on the computer. Users will  
be forced to enter passwords whenever they log on to their Passport account or other  
network resources that aren't accessible to their domain account. Testing has shown that  
clients running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 will be unable to connect to  
Distributed File System (DFS) shares in untrusted domains. Enabling this setting also  
makes it impossible to specify alternate credentials for scheduled tasks, this can cause a  
variety of problems. For example, some third party backup products will no longer work.  
This policy setting should have no impact on users who access network resources that are  
configured to allow access with their Active Directory-based domain account.

Description:  

This policy setting determines which communication sessions, or pipes, will have attributes

Description:  

This policy setting determines which registry paths will be accessible over the network,  
regardless of the users or groups listed in the access control list (ACL) of the winreg

Note: This setting does not exist in Windows XP. There was a setting with that name in  
Windows XP, but it is called "Network access: Remotely accessible registry paths and sub-

Note #2: When you configure this setting you specify a list of one or more objects. The  
delimiter used when entering the list is a line feed or carriage return, that is, type the first  
object on the list, press the Enter button, type the next object, press Enter again, etc. The  
setting value is stored as a comma-delimited list in group policy security templates. It is  
also rendered as a comma-delimited list in Group Policy Editor's display pane and the  
Resultant Set of Policy console. It is recorded in the registry as a line-feed delimited list in a

Rationale:  

The registry is a database that contains computer configuration information, and much of  
the information is sensitive. An attacker could use this information to facilitate  
unauthorized activities. To reduce the risk of such an attack, suitable ACLs are assigned  
throughout the registry to help protect it from access by unauthorized users.

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller

Description:  

When enabled, this policy setting restricts anonymous access to only those shares and  
pipes that are named in the Network access: Named pipes that can be accessed  
anonymously and Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously settings.  
This policy setting controls null session access to shares on your computers by adding  
RestrictNullSessAccess with the value  1 in the  

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters  

registry key. This registry value toggles null session shares on or off to control whether the  
server service restricts unauthenticated clients' access to named resources.

None - this is the default behavior. If you choose to enable this setting and are supporting  
Windows NT 4.0 domains, you should check if any of the named pipes are required to  
maintain trust relationships between the domains, and then add the pipe to the Network

2.3.10.13 (L1) Ensure 'Network access: Sharing and security model for  
local accounts' is set to 'Classic - local users authenticate as themselves'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines how network logons that use local accounts are  
authenticated. The Classic option allows precise control over access to resources, including  
the ability to assign different types of access to different users for the same resource. The  
Guest only option allows you to treat all users equally. In this context, all users authenticate  
as Guest only to receive the same access level to a given resource.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Classic - local users authenticate as  
themselves.  

Note: This setting does not affect interactive logons that are performed remotely by using  
such services as Telnet or Remote Desktop Services (formerly called Terminal Services).  

Rationale:  

With the Guest only model, any user who can authenticate to your computer over the  
network does so with guest privileges, which probably means that they will not have write  
access to shared resources on that computer. Although this restriction does increase  
security, it makes it more difficult for authorized users to access shared resources on those  
computers because ACLs on those resources must include access control entries (ACEs) for  
the Guest account. With the Classic model, local accounts should be password protected.  
Otherwise, if Guest access is enabled, anyone can use those user accounts to access shared  
system resources.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default configuration for domain-joined computers.

2.3.11 Network security  

This section contains recommendations related to network security.  

2.3.11.1 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: Allow Local System to use  
computer identity for NTLM' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether Local System services that use Negotiate when  
reverting to NTLM authentication can use the computer identity. This policy is supported  
on at least Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

When connecting to computers running versions of Windows earlier than Windows Vista  
or Windows Server 2008 (non-R2), services running as Local System and using SPNEGO  
(Negotiate) that revert to NTLM use the computer identity. In Windows 7, if you are  
connecting to a computer running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista, then a system  
service uses either the computer identity or a NULL session. When connecting with a NULL  
session, a system-generated session key is created, which provides no protection but  
allows applications to sign and encrypt data without errors. When connecting with the  
computer identity, both signing and encryption is supported in order to provide data  
protection.  

Impact:  

Services running as Local System that use Negotiate when reverting to NTLM  
authentication will use the computer identity. This might cause some authentication  
requests between Windows operating systems to fail and log an error.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

2.3.11.3 (L1) Ensure 'Network Security: Allow PKU2U authentication  
requests to this computer to use online identities' is set to 'Disabled'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer.  

The Public Key Cryptography Based User-to-User (PKU2U) protocol introduced in  
Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support provider  
(SSP). The SSP enables peer-to-peer authentication, particularly through the Windows 7  
media and file sharing feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between  
computers that are not members of a domain.  

With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package,  
Spnego.dll. In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos  
or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, Negoexts.dll, which is  
treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including  
PKU2U.  

When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs,  
Negoexts.dll calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP  
obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers. When  
validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to the logon peer  
for validation and associates the user's certificate to a security token and the logon process  
completes.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

The PKU2U protocol is a peer-to-peer authentication protocol - authentication should be  
managed centrally in most managed networks.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default configuration for domain-joined computers.

2.3.11.4 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: Configure encryption types  
allowed for Kerberos' is set to 'AES128_HMAC_SHA1,  
AES256_HMAC_SHA1, Future encryption types' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to set the encryption types that Kerberos is allowed to use.  

The recommended state for this setting is: AES128_HMAC_SHA1, AES256_HMAC_SHA1,  
Future encryption types.  

Note: Some legacy applications and OSes may still require RC4_HMAC_MD5 - we recommend  
you test in your environment and verify whether you can safely remove it.  

Rationale:  

The strength of each encryption algorithm varies from one to the next, choosing stronger  
algorithms will reduce the risk of compromise however doing so may cause issues when  
the computer attempts to authenticate with systems that do not support them.  

                                       

                                                                                                        281  | P a g e

Impact:  

If not selected, the encryption type will not be allowed. This setting may affect  
compatibility with client computers or services and applications. Multiple selections are  
permitted.  

Note: Some legacy applications and OSes may still require RC4_HMAC_MD5 - we recommend  
you test in your environment and verify whether you can safely remove it.  

Note #2: Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) and below allow DES for Kerberos by default, but  
later OS versions do not.  

Note #3: Some prerequisites might need to be met on Domain Controllers to support  
Kerberos AES 128 and 256 bit encryption types, as well as enabling support for Kerberos  
AES 128 and 256 bit on user accounts (in account options) for this recommendation to  
work correctly.  

Note #4: If your organization uses Azure Files, please note that Microsoft did not introduce  
AES 256 Kerberos encryption support for it until AD DS authentication module v0.2.2.

2.3.11.5 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: Do not store LAN Manager hash  
value on next password change' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether the LAN Manager (LM) hash value for the new  
password is stored when the password is changed. The LM hash is relatively weak and  
prone to attack compared to the cryptographically stronger Microsoft Windows NT hash.  
Since LM hashes are stored on the local computer in the security database, passwords can  
then be easily compromised if the database is attacked.  

Note: Older operating systems and some third-party applications may fail when this policy  
setting is enabled. Also, note that the password will need to be changed on all accounts  
after you enable this setting to gain the proper benefit.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

The SAM file can be targeted by attackers who seek access to username and password  
hashes. Such attacks use special tools to crack passwords, which can then be used to  
impersonate users and gain access to resources on your network. These types of attacks  
will not be prevented if you enable this policy setting, but it will be much more difficult for  
these types of attacks to succeed.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior. Earlier operating systems such as Windows 95,  
Windows 98, and Windows ME as well as some third-party applications will fail.

2.3.11.7 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: LAN Manager authentication  
level' is set to 'Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating  
Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network.  
LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features,  
and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is  
the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for  
some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication  
includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is  
used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations:  

        Join a domain  
        Authenticate between Active Directory forests  
        Authenticate to down-level domains  
        Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003,  
         or Windows XP  
        Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain  

The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which  
challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects  
the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated,  
and the level of authentication accepted by servers.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM &  
NTLM.  

                                      

                                                                                                    288  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 290-----------------------

  

Rationale:  

Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and NTLM  
authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send  
LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (non- 
R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this  
meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over  
the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily  
reproduce the user's password.  

The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the  
Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003  
domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for  
network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for  
Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process,  
NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use  
NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are  
members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with  
Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these reasons, it is strongly  
preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible.  

Impact:  

Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server  
supports it; Domain Controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2  
authentication). Clients that do not support NTLMv2 authentication will not be able to  
authenticate in the domain and access domain resources by using LM and NTLM.

2.3.11.8 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: LDAP client signing  
requirements' is set to 'Negotiate signing' or higher (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines the level of data signing that is requested on behalf of clients  
that issue LDAP BIND requests.  

Note: This policy setting does not have any impact on LDAP simple bind  
(ldap_simple_bind) or LDAP simple bind through SSL (ldap_simple_bind_s). No  
Microsoft LDAP clients that are included with Windows XP Professional use  
ldap_simple_bind or ldap_simple_bind_s to communicate with a Domain Controller.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Negotiate signing. Configuring this setting to  
Require signing also conforms to the benchmark.  

Rationale:  

Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks in which an intruder  
captures the packets between the client and server, modifies them, and then forwards them  
to the server. For an LDAP server, this susceptibility means that an attacker could cause a  
server to make decisions that are based on false or altered data from the LDAP queries. To  
lower this risk in your network, you can implement strong physical security measures to  
protect the network infrastructure. Also, you can make all types of man-in-the-middle  
attacks extremely difficult if you require digital signatures on all network packets by means  
of IPsec authentication headers.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior. However, if you choose instead to configure the server  
to require LDAP signatures then you must also configure the client. If you do not configure  
the client it will not be able to communicate with the server, which could cause many  
features to fail, including user authentication, Group Policy, and logon scripts, because the  
caller will be told that the LDAP BIND command request failed.

2.3.11.9 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: Minimum session security for  
NTLM SSP based (including secure RPC) clients' is set to 'Require  
NTLMv2 session security, Require 128-bit encryption' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines which behaviors are allowed by clients for applications  
using the NTLM Security Support Provider (SSP). The SSP Interface (SSPI) is used by  
applications that need authentication services. The setting does not modify how the  
authentication sequence works but instead require certain behaviors in applications that  
use the SSPI.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Require NTLMv2 session security, Require  
128-bit encryption.  

Note: These values are dependent on the Network security: LAN Manager Authentication  
Level  (Rule 2.3.11.7) security setting value.  

Rationale:  

You can enable both options for this policy setting to help protect network traffic that uses  
the NTLM Security Support Provider (NTLM SSP) from being exposed or tampered with by  
an attacker who has gained access to the same network. In other words, these options help  
protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.  

Impact:  

NTLM connections will fail if NTLMv2 protocol and strong encryption (128-bit) are not  
both negotiated. Client applications that are enforcing these settings will be unable to  
communicate with older servers that do not support them.

2.3.13 Shutdown  

This section contains recommendations related to the Windows shutdown functionality.  

2.3.13.1 (L1) Ensure 'Shutdown: Allow system to be shut down without  
having to log on' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether a computer can be shut down when a user is not  
logged on. If this policy setting is enabled, the shutdown command is available on the  
Windows logon screen. It is recommended to disable this policy setting to restrict the  
ability to shut down the computer to users with credentials on the system.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Note: In Server 2008 R2 and older versions, this setting had no impact on Remote Desktop  
(RDP) / Terminal Services sessions - it only affected the local console. However, Microsoft  
changed the behavior in Windows Server 2012 (non-R2) and above, where if set to  
Enabled, RDP sessions are also allowed to shut down or restart the server.  

Rationale:  

Users who can access the console locally could shut down the computer. Attackers could  
also walk to the local console and restart the server, which would cause a temporary DoS  
condition. Attackers could also shut down the server and leave all of its applications and  
services unavailable. As noted in the Description above, the Denial of Service (DoS) risk of  
enabling this setting dramatically increases in Windows Server 2012 (non-R2) and above,  
as even remote users could then shut down or restart the server from the logon screen of  
an RDP session.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

2.3.15 System objects  

This section contains recommendations related to system objects.  

2.3.15.1 (L1) Ensure 'System objects: Require case insensitivity for non- 
Windows subsystems' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether case insensitivity is enforced for all subsystems.  
The Microsoft Win32 subsystem is case insensitive. However, the kernel supports case  
sensitivity for other subsystems, such as the Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX  
(POSIX). Because Windows is case insensitive (but the POSIX subsystem will support case  
sensitivity), failure to enforce this policy setting makes it possible for a user of the POSIX  
subsystem to create a file with the same name as another file by using mixed case to label  
it. Such a situation can block access to these files by another user who uses typical Win32  
tools, because only one of the files will be available.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Because Windows is case-insensitive but the POSIX subsystem will support case sensitivity,  
failure to enable this policy setting would make it possible for a user of that subsystem to  
create a file with the same name as another file but with a different mix of upper and lower  
case letters. Such a situation could potentially confuse users when they try to access such  
files from normal Win32 tools because only one of the files will be available.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines the strength of the default discretionary access control list  
(DACL) for objects. Active Directory maintains a global list of shared system resources,  
such as DOS device names, mutexes, and semaphores. In this way, objects can be located  
and shared among processes. Each type of object is created with a default DACL that  
specifies who can access the objects and what permissions are granted.

2.3.17 User Account Control  

This section contains recommendations related to User Account Control.  

2.3.17.1 (L1) Ensure 'User Account Control: Admin Approval Mode for  
the Built-in Administrator account' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting controls the behavior of Admin Approval Mode for the built-in  
Administrator account.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

One of the risks that the User Account Control feature introduced with Windows Vista is  
trying to mitigate is that of malicious software running under elevated credentials without  
the user or administrator being aware of its activity. An attack vector for these programs  
was to discover the password of the account named "Administrator" because that user  
account was created for all installations of Windows. To address this risk, in Windows Vista  
and newer, the built-in Administrator account is now disabled by default. In a default  
installation of a new computer, accounts with administrative control over the computer are  
initially set up in one of two ways:  

        If the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user account you create has the  
         equivalent permissions as a local administrator.  
        If the computer is joined to a domain, no local administrator accounts are created.  
         The Enterprise or Domain Administrator must log on to the computer and create  
         one if a local administrator account is warranted.  

Once Windows is installed, the built-in Administrator account may be manually enabled,  
but we strongly recommend that this account remain disabled.  

                                      

                                                                                                    303  | P a g e

 Description:  

This policy setting controls the behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators.

 of elevated privilege operations and permits the administrator to prevent a malicious  
program from elevating its privilege when the program attempts to do so.  

 Impact:  

When an operation (including execution of a Windows binary) requires elevation of  
privilege, the user is prompted on the secure desktop to select either Permit or Deny. If the  
user selects Permit, the operation continues with the user's highest available privilege.

2.3.17.3 (L1) Ensure 'User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation  
prompt for standard users' is set to 'Automatically deny elevation  
requests' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting controls the behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Automatically deny elevation requests.  

Rationale:  

One of the risks that the User Account Control feature introduced with Windows Vista is  
trying to mitigate is that of malicious programs running under elevated credentials without  
the user or administrator being aware of their activity. This setting raises awareness to the  
user that a program requires the use of elevated privilege operations and requires that the  
user be able to supply administrative credentials in order for the program to run.  

Impact:  

When an operation requires elevation of privilege, a configurable access denied error  
message is displayed. An enterprise that is running desktops as standard user may choose  
this setting to reduce help desk calls.  

Note: With this setting configured as recommended, the default error message displayed  
when a user attempts to perform an operation or run a program requiring privilege  
elevation (without Administrator rights) is " This program will not run. This program is  
blocked by group policy. For more information, contact your system administrator." Some  
users who are not used to seeing this message may believe that the operation or program  
they attempted to run is specifically blocked by group policy, as that is what the message  
seems to imply. This message may therefore result in user questions as to why that specific  
operation/program is blocked, when in fact, the problem is that they need to perform the  
operation or run the program with an Administrative account (or "Run as Administrator" if  
it is already an Administrator account), and they are not doing that.  

                                      

                                                                                                     307  | P a g e

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting controls the behavior of application installation detection for the  
computer.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Some malicious software will attempt to install itself after being given permission to run.  
For example, malicious software with a trusted application shell. The user may have given  
permission for the program to run because the program is trusted, but if they are then  
prompted for installation of an unknown component this provides another way of trapping  
the software before it can do damage  

Impact:  

When an application installation package is detected that requires elevation of privilege,  
the user is prompted to enter an administrative user name and password. If the user enters  
valid credentials, the operation continues with the applicable privilege.

2.3.17.5 (L1) Ensure 'User Account Control: Only elevate  UIAccess  
applications that are installed in secure locations' is set to 'Enabled'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting controls whether applications that request to run with a User Interface  
Accessibility (UIAccess) integrity level must reside in a secure location in the file system.  
Secure locations are limited to the following:  

        …\Program Files\, including subfolders  
        …\Windows\System32\  
        …\Program Files (x86)\, including subfolders (for 64-bit versions of Windows)  

Note: Windows enforces a public key infrastructure (PKI) signature check on any  
interactive application that requests to run with a UIAccess integrity level regardless of the  
state of this security setting.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

UIAccess Integrity allows an application to bypass User Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI)  
restrictions when an application is elevated in privilege from a standard user to an  
administrator. This is required to support accessibility features such as screen readers that  
are transmitting user interfaces to alternative forms. A process that is started with  
UIAccess rights has the following abilities:  

        To set the foreground window.  
        To drive any application window using SendInput function.  
        To use read input for all integrity levels using low-level hooks, raw input,  
         GetKeyState, GetAsyncKeyState, and GetKeyboardInput.  
        To set journal hooks.  
        To uses AttachThreadInput to attach a thread to a higher integrity input queue.

Description:  

This policy setting controls the behavior of all User Account Control (UAC) policy settings

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting controls whether the elevation request prompt is displayed on the  
interactive user's desktop or the secure desktop.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Standard elevation prompt dialog boxes can be spoofed, which may cause users to disclose  
their passwords to malicious software. The secure desktop presents a very distinct  
appearance when prompting for elevation, where the user desktop dims, and the elevation  
prompt UI is more prominent. This increases the likelihood that users who become  
accustomed to the secure desktop will recognize a spoofed elevation prompt dialog box  
and not fall for the trick.

Description:  

This service spools print jobs and handles interaction with printers.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

Disabling the Print Spooler (Spooler) service mitigates the PrintNightmare vulnerability  
(CVE-2021-34527) and other attacks against the service.  

Impact:  

Domain Controllers will not be able to prune published printers from Active Directory. By  
default, Domain Controllers prune printer objects from Active Directory if the computer  
that published them doesn't respond to contact requests.  

Domain Controllers will not be able to act as a print server, sharing printers for clients.  

Applications on and users logged in at Domain Controllers will not be able to print,  
including printing to files (such as Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF)) which uses the  
Print Spooler service.

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This service spools print jobs and handles interaction with printers.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

Disabling the Print Spooler (Spooler) service mitigates the PrintNightmare vulnerability  
(CVE-2021-34527) and other attacks against the service.  

Impact:  

Member Servers will not be able to act as a print server, sharing printers for clients.  

Applications on and users logged in to Member Servers will not be able to print, including  
printing to files (such as Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF)) which uses the Print  
Spooler service.

9 Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security  
(formerly Windows Firewall with Advanced Security)  

This section contains recommendations for configuring the Windows Firewall.  

Note: In older versions of Microsoft Windows, this section was named Windows Firewall  
with Advanced Security, but it was renamed to  Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced  
Security starting with the Server 2019 release.  

9.1 Domain Profile  

This section contains recommendations for the Domain Profile of the Windows Firewall.  

9.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Windows Firewall: Domain: Firewall state' is set to 'On  
(recommended)' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

Select On (recommended) to have Windows Firewall with Advanced Security use the  
settings for this profile to filter network traffic. If you select Off, Windows Firewall with  
Advanced Security will not use any of the firewall rules or connection security rules for this  
profile.  

The recommended state for this setting is: On (recommended).  

Rationale:  

If the firewall is turned off all traffic will be able to access the system and an attacker may  
be more easily able to remotely exploit a weakness in a network service.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

9.1.3 (L1) Ensure 'Windows Firewall: Domain: Outbound connections' is  
set to 'Allow (default)' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting determines the behavior for outbound connections that do not match an  
outbound firewall rule.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Allow (default).  

Rationale:  

Some people believe that it is prudent to block all outbound connections except those  
specifically approved by the user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion,  
blocking outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of  
dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web browser  
or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value  
because if an attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall  
anyway.

None - this is the default behavior.

Description:  

Select this option to have Windows Firewall with Advanced Security display notifications to

Rationale:  

Firewall notifications can be complex and may confuse the end users, who would not be  
able to address the alert.

Description:  

Select On (recommended) to have Windows Firewall with Advanced Security use the  
settings for this profile to filter network traffic. If you select Off, Windows Firewall with  
Advanced Security will not use any of the firewall rules or connection security rules for this  
profile.

Rationale:  

If the firewall is turned off all traffic will be able to access the system and an attacker may  
be more easily able to remotely exploit a weakness in a network service.

9.2.3 (L1) Ensure 'Windows Firewall: Private: Outbound connections' is  
set to 'Allow (default)' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting determines the behavior for outbound connections that do not match an  
outbound firewall rule.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Allow (default).  

Note: If you set Outbound connections to Block and then deploy the firewall policy by using  
a GPO, computers that receive the GPO settings cannot receive subsequent Group Policy  
updates unless you create and deploy an outbound rule that enables Group Policy to work.  
Predefined rules for Core Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to  
work. Ensure that these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test firewall profiles  
before deploying.  

Rationale:  

Some people believe that it is prudent to block all outbound connections except those  
specifically approved by the user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion,  
blocking outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of  
dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web browser  
or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value  
because if an attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall  
anyway.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

Description:  

Select this option to have Windows Firewall with Advanced Security display notifications to  
the user when a program is blocked from receiving inbound connections.  

The recommended state for this setting is: No.  

Note: When the Apply local firewall rules setting is configured to No, it's  
recommended to also configure the Display a notification setting to No. Otherwise,  
users will continue to receive messages that ask if they want to unblock a restricted  
inbound connection, but the user's response will be ignored.  

Rationale:  

Firewall notifications can be complex and may confuse the end users, who would not be  
able to address the alert.

9.3.3 (L1) Ensure 'Windows Firewall: Public: Outbound connections' is  
set to 'Allow (default)' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting determines the behavior for outbound connections that do not match an  
outbound firewall rule.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Allow (default).  

Note: If you set Outbound connections to Block and then deploy the firewall policy by using  
a GPO, computers that receive the GPO settings cannot receive subsequent Group Policy  
updates unless you create and deploy an outbound rule that enables Group Policy to work.  
Predefined rules for Core Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to  
work. Ensure that these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test firewall profiles  
before deploying.  

Rationale:  

Some people believe that it is prudent to block all outbound connections except those  
specifically approved by the user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion,  
blocking outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of  
dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web browser  
or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value  
because if an attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall  
anyway.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

Description:  

Select this option to have Windows Firewall with Advanced Security display notifications to  
the user when a program is blocked from receiving inbound connections.  

The recommended state for this setting is: No.  

Rationale:  

Some organizations may prefer to avoid alarming users when firewall rules block certain  
types of network activity. However, notifications can be helpful when troubleshooting  
network issues involving the firewall.  

Impact:  

Windows Firewall will not display a notification when a program is blocked from receiving  
inbound connections.

Description:  

This setting controls whether local administrators are allowed to create local firewall rules  
that apply together with firewall rules configured by Group Policy.  

The recommended state for this setting is: No.  

Note: When the Apply local firewall rules setting is configured to No, it's  
recommended to also configure the Display a notification setting to No. Otherwise,  
users will continue to receive messages that ask if they want to unblock a restricted  
inbound connection, but the user's response will be ignored.  

Rationale:  

When in the Public profile, there should be no special local firewall exceptions per  
computer. These settings should be managed by a centralized policy.  

Impact:  

Administrators can still create firewall rules, but the rules will not be applied.

Description:  

Use this option to log when Windows Firewall with Advanced Security discards an inbound  
packet for any reason. The log records why and when the packet was dropped. Look for  
entries with the word DROP in the action column of the log.

17.1 Account Logon  

This section contains recommendations for configuring the Account Logon audit policy.  

17.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Audit Credential Validation' is set to 'Success and  
Failure' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This subcategory reports the results of validation tests on credentials submitted for a user  
account logon request. These events occur on the computer that is authoritative for the  
credentials. For domain accounts, the Domain Controller is authoritative, whereas for local  
accounts, the local computer is authoritative. In domain environments, most of the Account  
Logon events occur in the Security log of the Domain Controllers that are authoritative for  
the domain accounts. However, these events can occur on other computers in the  
organization when local accounts are used to log on. Events for this subcategory include:  

        4774: An account was mapped for logon.  
        4775: An account could not be mapped for logon.  
        4776: The Domain Controller attempted to validate the credentials for an account.  
        4777: The Domain Controller failed to validate the credentials for an account.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure.  

Rationale:  

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

Impact:  

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your  
organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be  
available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit  
settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by  
all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data  
storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries  
may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

Description:  

This subcategory reports the results of events generated after a Kerberos authentication  
TGT request. Kerberos is a distributed authentication service that allows a client running  
on behalf of a user to prove its identity to a server without sending data across the  
network. This helps mitigate an attacker or server from impersonating a user.  

        4768: A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested.

17.2 Account Management  

This section contains recommendations for configuring the Account Management audit  
policy.  

17.2.1 (L1) Ensure 'Audit Application Group Management' is set to  
'Success and Failure' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by changes to application groups  
such as the following:  

        Application group is created, changed, or deleted.  
        Member is added or removed from an application group.  

Application groups are utilized by Windows Authorization Manager, which is a flexible  
framework created by Microsoft for integrating role-based access control (RBAC) into  
applications. More information on Windows Authorization Manager is available at MSDN -  
Windows Authorization Manager.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure.  

Rationale:  

Auditing events in this category may be useful when investigating an incident.  

Impact:  

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your  
organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be  
available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit  
settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by  
all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data  
storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries  
may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

This subcategory reports each event of user account management, such as when a user  
account is created, changed, or deleted; a user account is renamed, disabled, or enabled; or  
a password is set or changed. If you enable this Audit policy setting, administrators can  
track events to detect malicious, accidental, and authorized creation of user accounts.  
Events for this subcategory include:  

        4720: A user account was created.  
        4722: A user account was enabled.  
        4723: An attempt was made to change an account's password.  
        4724: An attempt was made to reset an account's password.  
        4725: A user account was disabled.

Impact:  

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your  
organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be  
available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit  
settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by  
all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data  
storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries

Description:  

This subcategory reports changes to objects in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).  
The types of changes that are reported are create, modify, move, and undelete operations  
that are performed on an object. DS Change auditing, where appropriate, indicates the old  
and new values of the changed properties of the objects that were changed. Only objects  
with SACLs cause audit events to be generated, and only when they are accessed in a  
manner that matches their SACL. Some objects and properties do not cause audit events to  
be generated due to settings on the object class in the schema. This subcategory applies  
only to Domain Controllers. Events for this subcategory include:  

        5136 : A directory service object was modified.  
        5137 : A directory service object was created.  
        5138 : A directory service object was undeleted.

Impact:  

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your

17.5.1 (L1) Ensure 'Audit Account Lockout' is set to include 'Failure'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This subcategory reports when a user's account is locked out as a result of too many failed  
logon attempts. Events for this subcategory include:  

        4625: An account failed to log on.  

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Failure.  

Rationale:  

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.  

Impact:  

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your  
organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be  
available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit  
settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by  
all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data  
storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries  
may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

Description:  

This policy allows you to audit the group membership information in the user’s logon  
token. Events in this subcategory are generated on the computer on which a logon session  
is created. For an interactive logon, the security audit event is generated on the computer  
that the user logged on to. For a network logon, such as accessing a shared folder on the  
network, the security audit event is generated on the computer hosting the resource.  

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Success.  

Note: A Windows 10, Server 2016 or newer OS is required to access and set this value in  
Group Policy.  

Rationale:  

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.  

Impact:  

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your  
organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be  
available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit  
settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by

Description:  

This subcategory reports when a special logon is used. A special logon is a logon that has  
administrator-equivalent privileges and can be used to elevate a process to a higher level.  
Events for this subcategory include:  

        4964 : Special groups have been assigned to a new logon.  

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Success.  

Rationale:  

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.  

Impact:  

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your  
organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be  
available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit  
settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by  
all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data  
storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries  
may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

17.6 Object Access  

This section contains recommendations for configuring the Object Access audit policy.  

17.6.1 (L1) Ensure 'Audit Detailed File Share' is set to include 'Failure'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This subcategory allows you to audit attempts to access files and folders on a shared folder.  
Events for this subcategory include:  

        5145: network share object was checked to see whether client can be granted  
         desired access.  

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Failure  

Rationale:  

Auditing the Failures will log which unauthorized users attempted (and failed) to get  
access to a file or folder on a network share on this computer, which could possibly be an  
indication of malicious intent.  

Impact:  

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your  
organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be  
available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit  
settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by  
all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data  
storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries

(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to audit attempts to access a shared folder.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure.  

Note: There are no system access control lists (SACLs) for shared folders. If this policy  
setting is enabled, access to all shared folders on the system is audited.  

Rationale:  

In an enterprise managed environment, it's important to track deletion, creation,  
modification, and access events for network shares. Any unusual file sharing activity may  
be useful in an investigation of potentially malicious activity.  

Impact:  

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your  
organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be  
available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by the management of task  
scheduler jobs or COM+ objects.  

For scheduler jobs, the following are audited:  

        Job created.  
        Job deleted.  
        Job enabled.  
        Job disabled.  
        Job updated.  

For COM+ objects, the following are audited:  

        Catalog object added.  
        Catalog object updated.  
        Catalog object deleted.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure.  

Rationale:  

The unexpected creation of scheduled tasks and COM+ objects could potentially be an  
indication of malicious activity. Since these types of actions are generally low volume, it  
may be useful to capture them in the audit logs for use during an investigation.

17.6.4 (L1) Ensure 'Audit Removable Storage' is set to 'Success and  
Failure' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to audit user attempts to access file system objects on a  
removable storage device. A security audit event is generated only for all objects for all  
types of access requested. If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated  
each time an account accesses a file system object on a removable storage. Success audits  
record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts. If you do not  
configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated when an account accesses a file  
system object on a removable storage.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure.  

Note: A Windows 8.0, Server 2012 (non-R2) or newer OS is required to access and set this  
value in Group Policy.  

Rationale:  

Auditing removable storage may be useful when investigating an incident. For example, if  
an individual is suspected of copying sensitive information onto a USB drive.  

Impact:  

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your  
organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be  
available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit  
settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by  
all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data  
storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.  

Impact:  

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your  
organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be  
available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit  
settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by  
all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data  
storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries  
may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This subcategory determines whether the operating system generates audit events when  
changes are made to policy rules for the Microsoft Protection Service (MPSSVC.exe). Events  
for this subcategory include:  

        4944: The following policy was active when the Windows Firewall started.  
        4945: A rule was listed when the Windows Firewall started.  
        4946: A change has been made to Windows Firewall exception list. A rule was  
         added.  
        4947: A change has been made to Windows Firewall exception list. A rule was  
         modified.  
        4948: A change has been made to Windows Firewall exception list. A rule was  
         deleted.  
        4949: Windows Firewall settings were restored to the default values.  
        4950: A Windows Firewall setting has changed.  
        4951: A rule has been ignored because its major version number was not recognized  
         by Windows Firewall.  
        4952: Parts of a rule have been ignored because its minor version number was not  
         recognized by Windows Firewall. The other parts of the rule will be enforced.  
        4953: A rule has been ignored by Windows Firewall because it could not parse the  
         rule.  
        4954: Windows Firewall Group Policy settings have changed. The new settings have  
         been applied.  
        4956: Windows Firewall has changed the active profile.  
        4957: Windows Firewall did not apply the following rule.  
        4958: Windows Firewall did not apply the following rule because the rule referred  
         to items not configured on this computer.  

The recommended state for this setting is : Success and Failure  

Rationale:  

Changes to firewall rules are important for understanding the security state of the  
computer and how well it is protected against network attacks.

This section contains recommendations for configuring the Privilege Use audit policy.  

17.8.1 (L1) Ensure 'Audit Sensitive Privilege Use' is set to 'Success and  
Failure' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This subcategory reports when a user account or service uses a sensitive privilege. A  
sensitive privilege includes the following user rights:  

        Act as part of the operating system  
        Back up files and directories  
        Create a token object  
        Debug programs  
        Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation  
        Generate security audits  
        Impersonate a client after authentication  
        Load and unload device drivers  
        Manage auditing and security log  
        Modify firmware environment values  
        Replace a process-level token  
        Restore files and directories  
        Take ownership of files or other objects  

Auditing this subcategory will create a high volume of events. Events for this subcategory  
include:  

        4672: Special privileges assigned to new logon.  
        4673: A privileged service was called.  
        4674: An operation was attempted on a privileged object.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure.  

Rationale:  

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

Impact:  

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your  
organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be  
available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit  
settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by  
all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data  
storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries  
may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

17.9.1 (L1) Ensure 'Audit IPsec Driver' is set to 'Success and Failure'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This subcategory reports on the activities of the Internet Protocol security (IPsec) driver.  
Events for this subcategory include:  

        4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this  
         problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being  
         modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote  
         computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also  
         indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations.  
        4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem  
         persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer.  
        4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound  
         packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay.  
        4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured.  
         This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without  
         informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt.  
        4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security  
         Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is  
         corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the  
         remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may  
         also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that  
         case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored.  
        5478: IPsec Services has started successfully.  
        5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec  
         Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the  
         computer to potential security risks.  
        5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the  
         computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network  
         interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the  
         IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.  
        5483: IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be  
         started.  

                                      

                                                                                                     435  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 437-----------------------

  

        5484: IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The  
         shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack  
         or expose the computer to potential security risks.  
        5485: IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play event for  
         network interfaces. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network  
         interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the  
         IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.

17.9.5 (L1) Ensure 'Audit System Integrity' is set to 'Success and Failure'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This subcategory reports on violations of integrity of the security subsystem. Events for  
this subcategory include:  

        4612 : Internal resources allocated for the queuing of audit messages have been  
         exhausted, leading to the loss of some audits.  
        4615 : Invalid use of LPC port.  
        4618 : A monitored security event pattern has occurred.  
        4816 : RPC detected an integrity violation while decrypting an incoming message.  
        5038 : Code integrity determined that the image hash of a file is not valid. The file  
         could be corrupt due to unauthorized modification or the invalid hash could indicate  
         a potential disk device error.  
        5056: A cryptographic self test was performed.  
        5057: A cryptographic primitive operation failed.  
        5060: Verification operation failed.  
        5061: Cryptographic operation.  
        5062: A kernel-mode cryptographic self test was performed.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure.  

Rationale:  

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.  

Impact:  

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your  
organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be  
available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit  
settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by  
all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data  
storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries  
may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

18.2 LAPS  

This section contains recommendations for configuring Microsoft Local Administrator  
Password Solution (LAPS).  

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template AdmPwd.admx/adml that  
is included with LAPS.  

18.2.1 (L1) Ensure LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE is installed (MS  
only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

In May 2015, Microsoft released the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) tool,  
which is free and supported software that allows an organization to automatically set  
randomized and unique local Administrator account passwords on domain-attached  
workstations and Member Servers. The passwords are stored in a confidential attribute of  
the domain computer account and can be retrieved from Active Directory by approved  
Sysadmins when needed.  

The LAPS tool requires a small Active Directory Schema update in order to implement, as  
well as installation of a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) on targeted computers.  
Please see the LAPS documentation for details.  

LAPS supports Windows Vista or newer workstation OSes, and Server 2003 or newer  
server OSes. LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to a  
domain.  

Note: Organizations that utilize 3rd-party commercial software to manage unique &  
complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these  
LAPS recommendations.  

Note #2: LAPS is only designed to manage local Administrator passwords, and is therefore  
not recommended (or supported) for use directly on Domain Controllers, which do not

Rationale:  

Due to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations  
choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or Member Servers when  
deploying them. This creates a serious attack surface security risk because if an attacker  
manages to compromise one system and learn the password to its local Administrator  
account, then they can leverage that account to instantly gain access to all other computers  
that also use that password for their local Administrator account.  

Impact:  

No impact. When installed and registered properly, AdmPwd.dll takes no action unless  
given appropriate GPO commands during Group Policy refresh. It is not a memory-resident  
agent or service.  

In a disaster recovery scenario where Active Directory is not available, the local  
Administrator password will not be retrievable and a local password reset using a tool  
(such as Microsoft's Disaster and Recovery Toolset (DaRT) Recovery Image) may be  
necessary.  

Audit:  

The LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE can be verified to be installed by the presence of  
the following registry value:  

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows  
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\GPExtensions\{D76B9641-3288-4f75-942D- 
087DE603E3EA}:DllName  

Remediation:  

In order to utilize LAPS, a minor Active Directory Schema update is required, and a Group  
Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) must be installed on each managed computer. When  
LAPS is installed, the file AdmPwd.dll must be present in the following location and  
registered in Windows (the LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE installation does this for  
you):  

C:\Program Files\LAPS\CSE\AdmPwd.dll

Description:  

In May 2015, Microsoft released the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) tool,  
which is free and supported software that allows an organization to automatically set  
randomized and unique local Administrator account passwords on domain-attached  
workstations and Member Servers. The passwords are stored in a confidential attribute of  
the domain computer account and can be retrieved from Active Directory by approved  
Sysadmins when needed.  

The LAPS tool requires a small Active Directory Schema update in order to implement, as  
well as installation of a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) on targeted computers.  
Please see the LAPS documentation for details.  

LAPS supports Windows Vista or newer workstation OSes, and Server 2003 or newer  
server OSes. LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to a  
domain.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Note: Organizations that utilize 3rd-party commercial software to manage unique &  
complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these  
LAPS recommendations.  

Note #2: LAPS is only designed to manage local Administrator passwords, and is therefore  
not recommended (or supported) for use directly on Domain Controllers, which do not  
have a traditional local Administrator account. We strongly encourage you to only deploy  
the LAPS CSE and LAPS GPO settings to member servers and workstations.

18.2.5 (L1) Ensure 'Password Settings: Password Length' is set to  
'Enabled: 15 or more' (MS only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

In May 2015, Microsoft released the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) tool,  
which is free and supported software that allows an organization to automatically set  
randomized and unique local Administrator account passwords on domain-attached  
workstations and Member Servers. The passwords are stored in a confidential attribute of  
the domain computer account and can be retrieved from Active Directory by approved  
Sysadmins when needed.  

The LAPS tool requires a small Active Directory Schema update in order to implement, as  
well as installation of a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) on targeted computers.  
Please see the LAPS documentation for details.  

LAPS supports Windows Vista or newer workstation OSes, and Server 2003 or newer  
server OSes. LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to a  
domain.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 15 or more.  

Note: Organizations that utilize 3rd-party commercial software to manage unique &  
complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these  
LAPS recommendations.  

Note #2: LAPS is only designed to manage local Administrator passwords, and is therefore  
not recommended (or supported) for use directly on Domain Controllers, which do not  
have a traditional local Administrator account. We strongly encourage you to only deploy  
the LAPS CSE and LAPS GPO settings to member servers and workstations.  

Rationale:  

Due to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations  
choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or Member Servers when  
deploying them. This creates a serious attack surface security risk because if an attacker  
manages to compromise one system and learn the password to its local Administrator  
account, then they can leverage that account to instantly gain access to all other computers  
that also use that password for their local Administrator account.

18.3.1 (L1) Ensure 'Apply UAC restrictions to local accounts on network  
logons' is set to 'Enabled' (MS only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting controls whether local accounts can be used for remote administration via  
network logon (e.g., NET USE, connecting to C$, etc.). Local accounts are at high risk for  
credential theft when the same account and password is configured on multiple systems.  
Enabling this policy significantly reduces that risk.  

Enabled: Applies UAC token-filtering to local accounts on network logons. Membership in  
powerful group such as Administrators is disabled and powerful privileges are removed  
from the resulting access token. This configures the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy  
registry value to 0. This is the default behavior for Windows.  

Disabled: Allows local accounts to have full administrative rights when authenticating via  
network logon, by configuring the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value to 1.  

For more information about local accounts and credential theft, review the "Mitigating  
Pass-the-Hash (PtH) Attacks and Other Credential Theft Techniques" documents.  

For more information about LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy, see Microsoft Knowledge  
Base article 951016: Description of User Account Control and remote restrictions in  
Windows Vista.

18.3.2 (L1) Ensure 'Configure SMB v1 client driver' is set to 'Enabled:  
Disable driver (recommended)' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting configures the start type for the Server Message Block version 1 (SMBv1) client  
driver service (MRxSmb10), which is recommended to be disabled.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Disable driver (recommended).  

Note: Do not, under any circumstances, configure this overall setting as Disabled, as doing  
so will delete the underlying registry entry altogether, which will cause serious problems.  

Rationale:  

Since September 2016, Microsoft has strongly encouraged that SMBv1 be disabled and no  
longer used on modern networks, as it is a 30 year old design that is much more vulnerable  
to attacks then much newer designs such as SMBv2 and SMBv3.  

More information on this can be found at the following links:  

Stop using SMB1 | Storage at Microsoft  

Disable SMB v1 in Managed Environments with Group Policy – "Stay Safe" Cyber Security  
Blog  

Disabling SMBv1 through Group Policy – Microsoft Security Guidance blog  

Impact:  

Some legacy OSes (e.g. Windows XP, Server 2003 or older), applications and appliances  
may no longer be able to communicate with the system once SMBv1 is disabled. We  
recommend careful testing be performed to determine the impact prior to configuring this  
as a widespread control, and where possible, remediate any incompatibilities found with  
the vendor of the incompatible system. Microsoft is also maintaining a thorough (although  
not comprehensive) list of known SMBv1 incompatibilities at this link: SMB1 Product

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

Since September 2016, Microsoft has strongly encouraged that SMBv1 be disabled and no  
longer used on modern networks, as it is a 30 year old design that is much more vulnerable  
to attacks then much newer designs such as SMBv2 and SMBv3.  

More information on this can be found at the following links:  

Stop using SMB1 | Storage at Microsoft  

Disable SMB v1 in Managed Environments with Group Policy – "Stay Safe" Cyber Security  
Blog  

Disabling SMBv1 through Group Policy – Microsoft Security Guidance blog  

Impact:  

Some legacy OSes (e.g. Windows XP, Server 2003 or older), applications and appliances  
may no longer be able to communicate with the system once SMBv1 is disabled. We  
recommend careful testing be performed to determine the impact prior to configuring this  
as a widespread control, and where possible, remediate any incompatibilities found with  
the vendor of the incompatible system. Microsoft is also maintaining a thorough (although  
not comprehensive) list of known SMBv1 incompatibilities at this link: SMB1 Product  
Clearinghouse | Storage at Microsoft

Description:  

Windows includes support for Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection  
(SEHOP). We recommend enabling this feature to improve the security profile of the  
computer.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

This feature is designed to block exploits that use the Structured Exception Handler (SEH)  
overwrite technique. This protection mechanism is provided at run-time. Therefore, it  
helps protect applications regardless of whether they have been compiled with the latest  
improvements, such as the /SAFESEH option.

Description:  

This policy setting controls whether users who aren't Administrators can install print

require Administrator privileges. This is documented in KB5005652—Manage new Point  
and Print default driver installation behavior (CVE-2021-34481).  

Rationale:  

Restricting the installation of print drives to Administrators can help mitigate the  
PrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) and other Print Spooler attacks.

18.3.6 (L1) Ensure 'NetBT NodeType configuration' is set to 'Enabled: P- 
node (recommended)' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

Description:  

This setting determines which method NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) uses to register and  
resolve names. The available methods are:  

        The B-node (broadcast) method only uses broadcasts.  
        The P-node (point-to-point) method only uses name queries to a name server  
         (WINS).  
        The M-node (mixed) method broadcasts first, then queries a name server (WINS) if  
         broadcast failed.  
        The H-node (hybrid) method queries a name server (WINS) first, then broadcasts if  
         the query failed.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: P-node (recommended)  (point-to- 
point).  

Note: Resolution through LMHOSTS or DNS follows these methods. If the NodeType registry  
value is present, it overrides any DhcpNodeType registry value. If neither NodeType nor  
DhcpNodeType is present, the computer uses B-node (broadcast) if there are no WINS  
servers configured for the network, or H-node (hybrid) if there is at least one WINS server  
configured.  

Rationale:  

In order to help mitigate the risk of NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) poisoning attacks,  
setting the node type to P-node (point-to-point) will prevent the system from sending out  
NetBIOS broadcasts.  

Impact:  

NetBIOS name resolution queries will require a defined and available WINS server for  
external NetBIOS name resolution. If a WINS server is not defined or not reachable, and the  
desired hostname is not defined in the local cache, local LMHOSTS or HOSTS files, NetBIOS  
name resolution will fail.                                          

                                                                                                   483  | P a g e

18.4.1 (L1) Ensure 'MSS: (AutoAdminLogon) Enable Automatic Logon  
(not recommended)' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting is separate from the Welcome screen feature in Windows XP and Windows  
Vista; if that feature is disabled, this setting is not disabled. If you configure a computer for  
automatic logon, anyone who can physically gain access to the computer can also gain  
access to everything that is on the computer, including any network or networks to which  
the computer is connected. Also, if you enable automatic logon, the password is stored in  
the registry in plaintext, and the specific registry key that stores this value is remotely  
readable by the Authenticated Users group.  

For additional information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 324737: How to turn on  
automatic logon in Windows.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

If you configure a computer for automatic logon, anyone who can physically gain access to  
the computer can also gain access to everything that is on the computer, including any  
network or networks that the computer is connected to. Also, if you enable automatic  
logon, the password is stored in the registry in plaintext. The specific registry key that  
stores this setting is remotely readable by the Authenticated Users group. As a result, this  
entry is appropriate only if the computer is physically secured and if you ensure that  
untrusted users cannot remotely see the registry.

18.4.4 (L1) Ensure 'MSS: (EnableICMPRedirect) Allow ICMP redirects to  
override OSPF generated routes' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirects cause the IPv4 stack to plumb host  
routes. These routes override the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) generated routes.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

This behavior is expected. The problem is that the 10 minute time-out period for the ICMP  
redirect-plumbed routes temporarily creates a network situation in which traffic will no  
longer be routed properly for the affected host. Ignoring such ICMP redirects will limit the  
system's exposure to attacks that will impact its ability to participate on the network.  

Impact:  

When Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) is configured as an autonomous system  
boundary router (ASBR), it does not correctly import connected interface subnet routes.  
Instead, this router injects host routes into the OSPF routes. However, the OSPF router  
cannot be used as an ASBR router, and when connected interface subnet routes are  
imported into OSPF the result is confusing routing tables with strange routing paths.

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller

Description:  

This value controls how often TCP attempts to verify that an idle connection is still intact  
by sending a keep-alive packet. If the remote computer is still reachable, it acknowledges  
the keep-alive packet.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 300,000 or 5 minutes

Rationale:  

An attacker who is able to connect to network applications could establish numerous  
connections to cause a DoS condition.  

Impact:  

Keep-alive packets are not sent by default by Windows. However, some applications may  
configure the TCP stack flag that requests keep-alive packets. For such configurations, you  
can lower this value from the default setting of two hours to five minutes to disconnect  
inactive sessions more quickly.

18.4.6 (L1) Ensure 'MSS: (NoNameReleaseOnDemand) Allow the  
computer to ignore NetBIOS name release requests except from WINS  
servers' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

NetBIOS over TCP/IP is a network protocol that among other things provides a way to  
easily resolve NetBIOS names that are registered on Windows-based systems to the IP  
addresses that are configured on those systems. This setting determines whether the  
computer releases its NetBIOS name when it receives a name-release request.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

The NetBT protocol is designed not to use authentication, and is therefore vulnerable to  
spoofing. Spoofing makes a transmission appear to come from a user other than the user  
who performed the action. A malicious user could exploit the unauthenticated nature of the  
protocol to send a name-conflict datagram to a target computer, which would cause the  
computer to relinquish its name and not respond to queries.  

An attacker could send a request over the network and query a computer to release its  
NetBIOS name. As with any change that could affect applications, it is recommended that  
you test this change in a non-production environment before you change the production  
environment.  

The result of such an attack could be to cause intermittent connectivity issues on the target  
computer, or even to prevent the use of Network Neighborhood, domain logons, the NET  
SEND command, or additional NetBIOS name resolution.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

Rationale:  

An attacker who has gained control of a computer on the same network segment could  
configure a computer on the network to impersonate a router. Other computers with IRDP

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

The DLL search order can be configured to search for DLLs that are requested by running  
processes in one of two ways:  

        Search folders specified in the system path first, and then search the current  
         working folder.  
        Search current working folder first, and then search the folders specified in the  
         system path.  

When enabled, the registry value is set to 1. With a setting of 1, the system first searches  
the folders that are specified in the system path and then searches the current working  
folder. When disabled the registry value is set to 0 and the system first searches the current  
working folder and then searches the folders that are specified in the system path.  

Applications will be forced to search for DLLs in the system path first. For applications that  
require unique versions of these DLLs that are included with the application, this entry  
could cause performance or stability problems.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Note: More information on how Safe DLL search mode works is available at this link:  
Dynamic-Link Library Search Order - Windows applications | Microsoft Docs  

Rationale:  

If a user unknowingly executes hostile code that was packaged with additional files that  
include modified versions of system DLLs, the hostile code could load its own versions of  
those DLLs and potentially increase the type and degree of damage the code can render.

Rationale:  

The default grace period that is allowed for user movement before the screen saver lock  
takes effect is five seconds. If you leave the default grace period configuration, your  
computer is vulnerable to a potential attack from someone who could approach the console  
and attempt to log on to the computer before the lock takes effect. An entry to the registry  
can be made to adjust the length of the grace period.

(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting controls the number of times that TCP retransmits an individual data segment  
(non-connect segment) before the connection is aborted. The retransmission time-out is  
doubled with each successive retransmission on a connection. It is reset when responses  
resume. The base time-out value is dynamically determined by the measured round-trip  
time on the connection.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 3.  

Rationale:  

A malicious user could exhaust a target computer's resources if it never sent any  
acknowledgment messages for data that was transmitted by the target computer.  

Impact:  

TCP starts a retransmission timer when each outbound segment is passed to the IP. If no  
acknowledgment is received for the data in a given segment before the timer expires, then  
the segment is retransmitted up to three times.

18.4.11 (L2) Ensure 'MSS: (TcpMaxDataRetransmissions) How many

(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting controls the number of times that TCP retransmits an individual data segment  
(non-connect segment) before the connection is aborted. The retransmission time-out is  
doubled with each successive retransmission on a connection. It is reset when responses  
resume. The base time-out value is dynamically determined by the measured round-trip  
time on the connection.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 3.  

Rationale:  

A malicious user could exhaust a target computer's resources if it never sent any  
acknowledgment messages for data that was transmitted by the target computer.  

Impact:  

TCP starts a retransmission timer when each outbound segment is passed to the IP. If no  
acknowledgment is received for the data in a given segment before the timer expires, then  
the segment is retransmitted up to three times.

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting can generate a security audit in the Security event log when the log reaches a  
user-defined threshold.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 90% or less.  

Note: If log settings are configured to Overwrite events as needed or Overwrite events  
older than x days, this event will not be generated.  

Rationale:  

If the Security log reaches 90 percent of its capacity and the computer has not been  
configured to overwrite events as needed, more recent events will not be written to the log.  
If the log reaches its capacity and the computer has been configured to shut down when it  
can no longer record events to the Security log, the computer will shut down and will no  
longer be available to provide network services.  

Impact:  

An audit event will be generated when the Security log reaches the 90% percent full  
threshold (or whatever lower value may be set) unless the log is configured to overwrite  
events as needed.

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template DnsClient.admx/adml  
that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.  

18.5.4.1 (L1) Ensure 'Configure DNS over HTTPS (DoH) name resolution'  
is set to 'Enabled: Allow DoH' or higher (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting determines if DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is used by the system. DNS over HTTPS  
(DoH) is a protocol for performing remote Domain Name System (DNS) resolution over the  
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). For additional information on DNS over  
HTTPS (DoH), visit: Secure DNS Client over HTTPS (DoH) on Windows Server 2022 |  
Microsoft Docs.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Allow DoH. Configuring this setting to  
Enabled: Require DoH also conforms to the benchmark.  

Rationale:  

DNS over HTTPS (DoH) helps protect against DNS spoofing. Spoofing makes a transmission  
appear to come from a user other than the user who performed the action. It can also help  
prevent man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks because the session in-between is encrypted.  

                                      

                                                                                                     512  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 514-----------------------

  

Impact:  

If the option Enabled: Require DoH is chosen, this could limit 3rd party products from  
logging DNS traffic (in transit) as the traffic would be encrypted while in transit. The  
Require DoH option could also lead to domain-joined systems not functioning properly  
within the environment.  

The option Enabled: Allow DoH will perform DoH queries if the configured DNS servers  
support it. If they don´t support it, classic name resolution will be used. This is the safest  
option.  

Note: Per Microsoft, don't enable the Enabled: Require DoH option for domain-joined  
computers as Active Directory Domain Services is heavily reliant on DNS because the  
Windows Server DNS Server service does not support DoH queries.

18.5.4.2 (L1) Ensure 'Turn off multicast name resolution' is set to  
'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

Description:  

LLMNR is a secondary name resolution protocol. With LLMNR, queries are sent using  
multicast over a local network link on a single subnet from a client computer to another  
client computer on the same subnet that also has LLMNR enabled. LLMNR does not require  
a DNS server or DNS client configuration, and provides name resolution in scenarios in  
which conventional DNS name resolution is not possible.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

An attacker can listen on a network for these LLMNR (UDP/5355) or NBT-NS (UDP/137)  
broadcasts and respond to them, tricking the host into thinking that it knows the location  
of the requested system.  

Note: To completely mitigate local name resolution poisoning, in addition to this setting,  
the properties of each installed NIC should also be set to Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP  
(on the WINS tab in the NIC properties). Unfortunately, there is no global setting to achieve  
this that automatically applies to all NICs - it is a per-NIC setting that varies with different  
NIC hardware installations.  

Impact:  

In the event DNS is unavailable a system will be unable to request it from other systems on  
the same subnet.

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether Windows is allowed to download fonts and font  
catalog data from an online font provider.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

In an enterprise managed environment the IT department should be managing the changes  
to the system configuration, to ensure all changes are tested and approved.  

Impact:  

Windows will not connect to an online font provider and will only enumerate locally- 
installed fonts.

Description:  

This policy setting determines if the SMB client will allow insecure guest logons to an SMB

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

Insecure guest logons are used by file servers to allow unauthenticated access to shared  
folders.  

Impact:  

The SMB client will reject insecure guest logons. This was not originally the default  
behavior in older versions of Windows, but Microsoft changed the default behavior starting  
with Windows Server 2016 R1709: Guest access in SMB2 disabled by default in Windows  
10 and Windows Server 2016

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting changes the operational behavior of the Mapper I/O network protocol

Description:  

The Peer Name Resolution Protocol (PNRP) allows for distributed resolution of a name to  
an IPv6 address and port number. The protocol operates in the context of clouds. A cloud is  
a set of peer computers that can communicate with each other by using the same IPv6  
scope.  

Peer-to-Peer protocols allow for applications in the areas of RTC, collaboration, content  
distribution and distributed processing.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

This setting enhances the security of the environment and reduces the overall risk  
exposure related to peer-to-peer networking.  

Impact:  

Microsoft Peer-to-Peer Networking Services are turned off in their entirety, and all  
applications dependent on them will stop working.

18.5.11.2 (L1) Ensure 'Prohibit installation and configuration of Network  
Bridge on your DNS domain network' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

You can use this procedure to control a user's ability to install and configure a Network  
Bridge.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

The Network Bridge setting, if enabled, allows users to create a Layer 2 Media Access  
Control (MAC) bridge, enabling them to connect two or more physical network segments  
together. A Network Bridge thus allows a computer that has connections to two different  
networks to share data between those networks.  

In an enterprise managed environment, where there is a need to control network traffic to  
only authorized paths, allowing users to create a Network Bridge increases the risk and  
attack surface from the bridged network.  

Impact:  

Users cannot create or configure a Network Bridge.

Note: If the environment exclusively contains Windows 8.0 / Server 2012 (non-R2) or  
newer systems, then the "Privacy" setting may (optionally) also be set to enable SMB

----------------------- Page 539-----------------------

  

Rationale:  

In February 2015, Microsoft released a new control mechanism to mitigate a security risk  
in Group Policy as part of the MS15-011 / MSKB 3000483 security update. This mechanism  
requires both the installation of the new security update and also the deployment of  
specific group policy settings to all computers on the domain from Windows Vista / Server  
2008 (non-R2) or newer (the associated security patch to enable this feature was not  
released for Server 2003). A new group policy template (NetworkProvider.admx/adml)  
was also provided with the security update.  

Once the new GPO template is in place, the following are the minimum requirements to  
remediate the Group Policy security risk:  

\\*\NETLOGON RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1  

\\*\SYSVOL RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1  

Note: A reboot may be required after the setting is applied to a client machine to access the  
above paths.  

Additional guidance on the deployment of this security setting is available from the  
Microsoft Premier Field Engineering (PFE) Platforms TechNet Blog here: Guidance on  
Deployment of MS15-011 and MS15-014.  

Impact:  

Windows only allows access to the specified UNC paths after fulfilling additional security  
requirements.

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as  
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry locations:

18.5.19.2.1 (L2) Disable IPv6 (Ensure TCPIP6 Parameter  
'DisabledComponents' is set to '0xff (255)') (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a set of protocols that computers use to exchange  
information over the Internet and over home and business networks. IPv6 allows for many  
more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking, hosts and operating  
systems may not support IPv6 natively.  

The recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)  

Rationale:  

Since the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize  
IPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 components  
removes a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic on. As a result,  
we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not needed.  

                                      

                                                                                                     542  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 544-----------------------

  

Impact:  

Connectivity to other systems using IPv6 will no longer operate, and software that depends  
on IPv6 will cease to function. Examples of Microsoft applications that may use IPv6  
include: Remote Assistance, HomeGroup, DirectAccess, Windows Mail.  

This registry change is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 929852: How to  
disable IPv6 or its components in Windows.  

Note: This registry change does not take effect until the next reboot.  

Audit:  

Navigate to the Registry path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as  
prescribed.  

Remediation:  

To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to  0xff  
 (255) (DWORD):  

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TCPIP6\Parameters:Disabl 
edComponents  

Note: This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted.  

Note #2: Although Microsoft does not provide an ADMX template to configure this registry  
value, a custom .ADM template (Disable-IPv6-Components-KB929852.adm) is provided in  
the CIS Benchmark Remediation Kit to facilitate its configuration. Be aware though that  
simply turning off the group policy setting in the .ADM template will not "undo" the change  
once applied. Instead, the opposite setting must be applied to change the registry value to  
the opposite state.

18.5.21.1 (L1) Ensure 'Minimize the number of simultaneous

Prevent Wi-Fi when on Ethernet' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting prevents computers from establishing multiple simultaneous  
connections to either the Internet or to a Windows domain.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 3 = Prevent Wi-Fi when on  
Ethernet.  

Rationale:  

Preventing bridged network connections can help prevent a user unknowingly allowing  
traffic to route between internal and external networks, which risks exposure to sensitive  
internal data.  

Impact:  

While connected to an Ethernet connection, Windows won't allow use of a WLAN  
(automatically or manually) until Ethernet is disconnected. However, if a cellular data  
connection is available, it will always stay connected for services that require it, but no  
Internet traffic will be routed over cellular if an Ethernet or WLAN connection is present.

18.5.21.2 (L2) Ensure 'Prohibit connection to non-domain networks  
when connected to domain authenticated network' is set to 'Enabled'  
(MS only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting prevents computers from connecting to both a domain based network  
and a non-domain based network at the same time.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

The potential concern is that a user would unknowingly allow network traffic to flow  
between the insecure public network and the enterprise managed network.  

Impact:  

The computer responds to automatic and manual network connection attempts based on  
the following circumstances:  

Automatic connection attempts - When the computer is already connected to a domain  
based network, all automatic connection attempts to non-domain networks are blocked. -  
When the computer is already connected to a non-domain based network, automatic  
connection attempts to domain based networks are blocked.  

Manual connection attempts - When the computer is already connected to either a non- 
domain based network or a domain based network over media other than Ethernet, and a  
user attempts to create a manual connection to an additional network in violation of this  
policy setting, the existing network connection is disconnected and the manual connection  
is allowed. - When the computer is already connected to either a non-domain based  
network or a domain based network over Ethernet, and a user attempts to create a manual  
connection to an additional network in violation of this policy setting, the existing Ethernet  
connection is maintained and the manual connection attempt is blocked.

This section contains recommendations for printer settings.  

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template Printing.admx/adml  
that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.  

18.6.1 (L1) Ensure 'Allow Print Spooler to accept client connections' is  
set to 'Disabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting controls whether the Print Spooler service will accept client  
connections.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Note: The Print Spooler service must be restarted for changes to this policy to take effect.  

Warning: An exception to this recommendation must be made for print servers in order  
for them to function properly. Users will not be able to print to the server when client  
connections are disabled.  

Rationale:  

Disabling the ability for the Print Spooler service to accept client connections mitigates  
remote attacks against the PrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) and other  
remote Print Spooler attacks. However, this recommendation does not mitigate against  
local attacks on the Print Spooler service.  

                                      

                                                                                                      554  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 556-----------------------

  

Impact:  

Provided that the Print Spooler service is not disabled, applications on and users logged in  
to servers will continue to be able to print from the server . However, the Print Spooler  
service will not accept client connections or allow users to share printers. Note that all  
printers that were already shared will continue to be shared.  

Warning: An exception to this recommendation must be made for print servers in order  
for them to function properly. Users will not be able to print to the server when client

 18.6.2 (L1) Ensure 'Point and Print Restrictions: When installing drivers  
for a new connection' is set to 'Enabled: Show warning and elevation  
prompt' (Automated)  

 Profile Applicability:  

   Level 1 - Member Server  

   Level 1 - Domain Controller  

 Description:  

This policy setting controls whether computers will show a warning and a security  
 elevation prompt when users create a new printer connection using Point and Print.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Show warning and elevation  
prompt.  

 Note: On August 10, 2021, Microsoft announced a Point and Print Default Behavior Change  
which modifies the default Point and Print driver installation and update behavior to  
 require Administrator privileges. This is documented in KB5005652—Manage new Point  
and Print default driver installation behavior (CVE-2021-34481). This change overrides all  
 Point and Print Group Policy settings and ensures that only Administrators can install  
printer drivers from a print server using Point and Print.  

 Rationale:  

 Enabling Windows User Account Control (UAC) for the installation of new print drivers can  
help mitigate the PrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) and other Print Spooler  
attacks.  

Although the Point and Print default driver installation behavior overrides this setting, it is  
 important to configure this as a backstop in the event that behavior is reversed.  

 Impact:  

 None - this is the default behavior.

Profile Applicability:

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting blocks applications from using the network to send notifications to  
update tiles, tile badges, toast, or raw notifications. This policy setting turns off the  
connection between Windows and the Windows Push Notification Service (WNS). This  
policy setting also stops applications from being able to poll application services to update  
tiles.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Windows Push Notification Services (WNS) is a mechanism to receive 3rd-party  
notifications and updates from the cloud/Internet. In a high security environment, external  
systems, especially those hosted outside the organization, should be prevented from having  
an impact on the secure workstations.

18.8.3 Audit Process Creation  

This section contains settings related to auditing of process creation events.  

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template  
AuditSettings.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 8.1 & Server 2012  
R2 Administrative Templates (or newer).  

18.8.3.1 (L1) Ensure 'Include command line in process creation events' is  
set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting controls whether the process creation command line text is logged in  
security audit events when a new process has been created.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Note: This feature that this setting controls was not originally supported in server OSes  
older than Windows Server 2012 R2. However, in February 2015 Microsoft added support  
for the feature to Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2012 (non-R2) via an  
update - KB3004375. Therefore, this setting is also important to set on those older OSes.  

Rationale:  

Capturing process command line information in event logs can be very valuable when  
performing forensic investigations of attack incidents.  

Impact:  

Process command line information will be included in the event logs, which can contain  
sensitive or private information such as passwords or user data.  

Warning: There are potential risks of capturing credentials and sensitive information  
which could be exposed to users who have read-access to event logs. Microsoft provides a  
feature called "Protected Event Logging" to better secure event log data. For assistance  
with protecting event logging, visit: About Logging Windows - PowerShell | Microsoft Docs.

18.8.4 Credentials Delegation  

This section contains settings related to Credential Delegation.  

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template CredSsp.admx/adml  
that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.  

18.8.4.1 (L1) Ensure 'Encryption Oracle Remediation' is set to 'Enabled:  
Force Updated Clients' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

Some versions of the CredSSP protocol that is used by some applications (such as Remote  
Desktop Connection) are vulnerable to an encryption oracle attack against the client. This  
policy controls compatibility with vulnerable clients and servers and allows you to set the  
level of protection desired for the encryption oracle vulnerability.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Force Updated Clients.  

Rationale:  

This setting is important to mitigate the CredSSP encryption oracle vulnerability, for which  
information was published by Microsoft on 03/13/2018 in CVE-2018-0886 | CredSSP  
Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. All versions of Windows Server from Server 2008  
(non-R2) onwards are affected by this vulnerability, and will be compatible with this  
recommendation provided that they have been patched up through May 2018 (or later).  

Impact:  

Client applications which use CredSSP will not be able to fall back to the insecure versions  
and services using CredSSP will not accept unpatched clients. This setting should not be  
deployed until all remote hosts support the newest version, which is achieved by ensuring  
that all Microsoft security updates at least through May 2018 are installed.

18.8.4.2 (L1) Ensure 'Remote host allows delegation of non-exportable  
credentials' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

Remote host allows delegation of non-exportable credentials. When using credential  
delegation, devices provide an exportable version of credentials to the remote host. This  
exposes users to the risk of credential theft from attackers on the remote host. The  
Restricted Admin Mode and Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard features are two  
options to help protect against this risk.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Note: More detailed information on Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard and how  
it compares to Restricted Admin Mode can be found at this link: Protect Remote Desktop  
credentials with Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard (Windows 10) | Microsoft  
Docs  

Rationale:  

Restricted Admin Mode was designed to help protect administrator accounts by ensuring  
that reusable credentials are not stored in memory on remote devices that could  
potentially be compromised. Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard helps you protect  
your credentials over a Remote Desktop connection by redirecting Kerberos requests back  
to the device that is requesting the connection. Both features should be enabled and  
supported, as they reduce the chance of credential theft.  

Impact:  

The host will support the Restricted Admin Mode and Windows Defender Remote Credential  
Guard features.

18.8.5.1 (NG) Ensure 'Turn On Virtualization Based Security' is set to  
'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Next Generation Windows Security - Domain Controller  

  Next Generation Windows Security - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting specifies whether Virtualization Based Security is enabled. Virtualization  
Based Security uses the Windows Hypervisor to provide support for security services.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled  

Note: Virtualization Based Security requires a 64-bit version of Windows with Secure Boot  
enabled, which in turn requires that Windows was installed with a UEFI BIOS  
configuration, not a Legacy BIOS configuration. In addition, if running Windows on a virtual  
machine, the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) must be  
exposed by the host to the guest VM.  

More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at Windows  
Defender Credential Guard Requirements (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs  

Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using  
Azure IaaS VMs.  

                                      

                                                                                                    571  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 573-----------------------

  

Rationale:  

Kerberos, NTLM, and Credential manager isolate secrets by using virtualization-based  
security. Previous versions of Windows stored secrets in the Local Security Authority  
(LSA). Prior to Windows 10, the LSA stored secrets used by the operating system in its  
process memory. With Windows Defender Credential Guard enabled, the LSA process in  
the operating system talks to a new component called the isolated LSA process that stores  
and protects those secrets. Data stored by the isolated LSA process is protected using  
virtualization-based security and is not accessible to the rest of the operating system.  

Impact:  

Warning: All drivers on the system must be compatible with this feature or the system  
may crash. Ensure that this policy setting is only deployed to computers which are known  
to be compatible.  

Warning #2: Enabling Windows Defender Credential Guard on Domain Controllers is not  
supported. The domain controller hosts authentication services which integrate with  
processes isolated when Windows Defender Credential Guard is enabled, causing crashes.

(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Next Generation Windows Security - Domain Controller  

  Next Generation Windows Security - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting specifies whether Virtualization Based Security is enabled. Virtualization  
Based Security uses the Windows Hypervisor to provide support for security services.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Secure Boot and DMA Protection  

Note: Virtualization Based Security requires a 64-bit version of Windows with Secure Boot  
enabled, which in turn requires that Windows was installed with a UEFI BIOS  
configuration, not a Legacy BIOS configuration. In addition, if running Windows on a virtual  
machine, the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) must be  
exposed by the host to the guest VM.  

More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at Windows  
Defender Credential Guard Requirements (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs  

Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using  
Azure IaaS VMs.  

Rationale:  

Secure Boot can help reduce the risk of bootloader attacks and in conjunction with DMA  
protections to help protect data from being scraped from memory.  

Impact:  

Warning: All drivers on the system must be compatible with this feature or the system  
may crash. Ensure that this policy setting is only deployed to computers which are known  
to be compatible.

configuration, not a Legacy BIOS configuration. In addition, if running Windows on a virtual  
machine, the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) must be  
exposed by the host to the guest VM.  

More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at Windows  
Defender Credential Guard Requirements (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs  

Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using  
Azure IaaS VMs.  

Rationale:  

Credential Guard is not useful on Domain Controllers and can cause crashes on them.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.  

Warning: Enabling Windows Defender Credential Guard on Domain Controllers is not  
supported. The domain controller hosts authentication services which integrate with  
processes isolated when Windows Defender Credential Guard is enabled, causing crashes.

Description:  

Secure Launch protects the Virtualization Based Security environment from exploited  
vulnerabilities in device firmware.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Note: Virtualization Based Security requires a 64-bit version of Windows with Secure Boot  
enabled, which in turn requires that Windows was installed with a UEFI BIOS  
configuration, not a Legacy BIOS configuration. In addition, if running Windows on a virtual  
machine, the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) must be

Defender Credential Guard Requirements (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs  

Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using  
Azure IaaS VMs.  

Rationale:  

Secure Launch changes the way windows boots to use Intel Trusted Execution Technology  
(TXT) and Runtime BIOS Resilience features to prevent firmware exploits from being able  
to impact the security of the Windows Virtualization Based Security environment.  

Impact:

18.8.7.2 (L1) Ensure 'Prevent device metadata retrieval from the  
Internet' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to prevent Windows from retrieving device metadata from  
the Internet.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Note: This will not prevent the installation of basic hardware drivers, but does prevent  
associated 3rd-party utility software from automatically being installed under the context  
of the SYSTEM account.  

Rationale:  

Installation of software should be conducted by an authorized system administrator and  
not a standard user. Allowing automatic 3rd-party software installations under the context  
of the SYSTEM account has potential for allowing unauthorized access via backdoors or  
installation software bugs.  

Impact:  

Standard users without administrator privileges will not be able to install associated 3rd- 
party utility software for peripheral devices. This may limit the use of advanced features of  
those devices unless/until an administrator installs the associated utility software for the  
device.

18.8.14.1 (L1) Ensure 'Boot-Start Driver Initialization Policy' is set to  
'Enabled: Good, unknown and bad but critical' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to specify which boot-start drivers are initialized based on a  
classification determined by an Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver. The Early  
Launch Antimalware boot-start driver can return the following classifications for each  
boot-start driver:  

        Good: The driver has been signed and has not been tampered with.  
        Bad: The driver has been identified as malware. It is recommended that you do not  
         allow known bad drivers to be initialized.  
        Bad, but required for boot: The driver has been identified as malware, but the  
         computer cannot successfully boot without loading this driver.  
        Unknown: This driver has not been attested to by your malware detection application  
         and has not been classified by the Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver.  

If you enable this policy setting you will be able to choose which boot-start drivers to  
initialize the next time the computer is started.  

If your malware detection application does not include an Early Launch Antimalware boot- 
start driver or if your Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver has been disabled, this  
setting has no effect and all boot-start drivers are initialized.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Good, unknown and bad but  
critical.  

Rationale:  

This policy setting helps reduce the impact of malware that has already infected your  
system.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

18.8.21.2 (L1) Ensure 'Configure registry policy processing: Do not apply  
during periodic background processing' is set to 'Enabled: FALSE'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

The "Do not apply during periodic background processing" option prevents the system  
from updating affected policies in the background while the computer is in use. When  
background updates are disabled, policy changes will not take effect until the next user  
logon or system restart.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: FALSE  (unchecked).  

Rationale:  

Setting this option to false (unchecked) will ensure that domain policy changes take effect  
more quickly, as compared to waiting until the next user logon or system restart.  

Impact:  

Group Policies will be reapplied every time they are refreshed, which could have a slight  
impact on performance.  

Audit:  

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as  
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:

(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

The "Process even if the Group Policy objects have not changed" option updates and  
reapplies policies even if the policies have not changed.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: TRUE  (checked).  

Rationale:  

Setting this option to true (checked) will ensure unauthorized changes that might have  
been configured locally are forced to match the domain-based Group Policy settings again.

Group Policies will be reapplied even if they have not been changed, which could have a

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether the Windows device is allowed to participate in  
cross-device experiences (continue experiences).  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

A cross-device experience is when a system can access app and send messages to other  
devices. In an enterprise managed environment only trusted systems should be  
communicating within the network. Access to any other system should be prohibited.  

Impact:  

The Windows device will not be discoverable by other devices, and cannot participate in  
cross-device experiences.

sharing ' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting turns off data sharing from the handwriting recognition personalization tool.  

The handwriting recognition personalization tool enables Tablet PC users to adapt  
handwriting recognition to their own writing style by providing writing samples. The tool  
can optionally share user writing samples with Microsoft to improve handwriting  
recognition in future versions of Windows. The tool generates reports and transmits them  
to Microsoft over a secure connection.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

A person's handwriting is Personally Identifiable Information (PII), especially when it  
comes to your signature. As such, it is unacceptable in many environments to automatically  
upload PII to a website without explicit approval by the user.  

Impact:  

Tablet PC users cannot choose to share writing samples from the handwriting recognition  
personalization tool with Microsoft.

Rationale:  

Users in an enterprise managed environment should not be registering their own copies of

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller

Description:  

This policy setting specifies whether Search Companion should automatically download  
content updates during local and Internet searches.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

There is a small risk that users will unknowingly reveal sensitive information because of  
the topics they are searching for. This risk is very low because even if this setting is enabled  
users still must submit search queries to the desired search engine in order to perform  
searches.  

Impact:  

Search Companion does not download content updates during searches.  

Note: Internet searches will still send the search text and information about the search to  
Microsoft and the chosen search provider. If you select Classic Search, the Search  
Companion feature will be unavailable. You can select Classic Search by clicking Start,  
Search, Change Preferences, and then Change Internet Search Behavior.

Description:  

This policy setting specifies whether the Windows Customer Experience Improvement  
Program can collect anonymous information about how Windows is used.  

Microsoft uses information collected through the Windows Customer Experience  
Improvement Program to improve features that are most used and to detect flaws so that  
they can be corrected more quickly. Enabling this setting will reduce the amount of data  
Microsoft is able to gather for this purpose. The recommended state for this setting is:  
Enabled.

Large enterprise managed environments may not want to have information collected by  
Microsoft from managed client computers.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

If a Windows Error occurs in a secure, enterprise managed environment, the error should  
be reported directly to IT staff for troubleshooting and remediation. There is no benefit to  
the corporation to report these errors directly to Microsoft, and there is some risk of  
unknowingly exposing sensitive data as part of the error.

set to 'Enabled: Automatic' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to set support for Kerberos to attempt authentication using  
the certificate for the device to the domain.  

Support for device authentication using certificate will require connectivity to a DC in the  
device account domain which supports certificate authentication for computer accounts.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Automatic.  

Rationale:  

Having stronger device authentication with the use of certificates is strongly encouraged  
over standard username and password authentication. Having this set to Automatic will  
allow certificate based authentication to be used whenever possible.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

18.8.26 Kernel DMA Protection  

This section contains recommendations for Kernel DMA Protection settings.  

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template DmaGuard.admx/adml  
that is included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1809 and Server 2019  
Administrative Templates (or newer).  

18.8.26.1 (L1) Ensure 'Enumeration policy for external devices  
incompatible with Kernel DMA Protection' is set to 'Enabled: Block All'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy is intended to provide additional security against external DMA-capable  
devices. It allows for more control over the enumeration of external DMA-capable devices  
that are not compatible with DMA Remapping/device memory isolation and sandboxing.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Block All.  

Note: This policy does not apply to 1394, PCMCIA or ExpressCard devices. The protection  
also only applies to Windows 10 R1803 or higher, and also requires a UEFI BIOS to  
function.  

Note #2: More information on this feature is available at this link: Kernel DMA Protection  
for Thunderbolt™ 3 (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs.  

Rationale:  

Device memory sandboxing allows the OS to leverage the I/O Memory Management Unit  
(IOMMU) of a device to block unpermitted I/O, or memory access, by the peripheral.  

                                      

                                                                                                    637  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 639-----------------------

  

Impact:  

External devices that are not compatible with DMA-remapping will not be enumerated and  
will not function unless/until the user has logged in successfully and has an unlocked user  
session. Once enumerated, these devices will continue to function, regardless of the state of  
the session. Devices that are compatible with DMA-remapping will be enumerated  
immediately, with their device memory isolated.

Description:  

This policy prevents the user from showing account details (email address or user name)  
on the sign-in screen.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

An attacker with access to the console (for example, someone with physical access or  
someone who is able to connect to the server through Remote Desktop Services) could  
view the name of the last user who logged on to the server. The attacker could then try to  
guess the password, use a dictionary, or use a brute-force attack to try and log on.

18.8.28.6 (L1) Ensure 'Turn off picture password sign-in' is set to  
'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to control whether a domain user can sign in using a picture  
password.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Note: If the picture password feature is permitted, the user's domain password is cached in  
the system vault when using it.  

Rationale:  

Picture passwords bypass the requirement for a typed complex password. In a shared work  
environment, a simple shoulder surf where someone observed the on-screen gestures  
would allow that person to gain access to the system without the need to know the complex  
password. Vertical monitor screens with an image are much more visible at a distance than  
horizontal key strokes, increasing the likelihood of a successful observation of the mouse  
gestures.

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to control whether a domain user can sign in using a  
convenience PIN. In Windows 10, convenience PIN was replaced with Passport, which has  
stronger security properties. To configure Passport for domain users, use the policies  
under Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows  
Components\Microsoft Passport for Work.  

Note: The user's domain password will be cached in the system vault when using this  
feature.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

A PIN is created from a much smaller selection of characters than a password, so in most

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to control the network connectivity state in standby on  
modern standby-capable systems.

Network connectivity in standby (while on battery) is not guaranteed. This connectivity  
restriction currently only applies to WLAN networks only, but is subject to change  
(according to Microsoft).

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to turn on or turn off Solicited (Ask for) Remote Assistance  
on this computer.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

There is slight risk that a rogue administrator will gain access to another user's desktop  
session, however, they cannot connect to a user's computer unannounced or control it  
without permission from the user. When an expert tries to connect, the user can still  
choose to deny the connection or give the expert view-only privileges. The user must  
explicitly click the Yes button to allow the expert to remotely control the workstation.

18.8.37 Remote Procedure Call

included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.  

18.8.37.1 (L1) Ensure 'Enable RPC Endpoint Mapper Client  
Authentication' is set to 'Enabled' (MS only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting controls whether RPC clients authenticate with the Endpoint Mapper  
Service when the call they are making contains authentication information. The Endpoint  
Mapper Service on computers running Windows NT4 (all service packs) cannot process  
authentication information supplied in this manner. This policy setting can cause a specific  
issue with 1-way forest trusts if it is applied to the trusting domain DCs (see Microsoft  
KB3073942), so we do not recommend applying it to Domain Controllers.  

Note: This policy will not be in effect until the system is rebooted.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Anonymous access to RPC services could result in accidental disclosure of information to  
unauthenticated users.  

Impact:  

RPC clients will authenticate to the Endpoint Mapper Service for calls that contain  
authentication information. Clients making such calls will not be able to communicate with  
the Windows NT4 Server Endpoint Mapper Service.

18.8.37.2 (L2) Ensure 'Restrict Unauthenticated RPC clients' is set to  
'Enabled: Authenticated' (MS only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting controls how the RPC server runtime handles unauthenticated RPC  
clients connecting to RPC servers.  

This policy setting impacts all RPC applications. In a domain environment this policy  
setting should be used with caution as it can impact a wide range of functionality including  
group policy processing itself. Reverting a change to this policy setting can require manual  
intervention on each affected machine. This policy setting should never be applied to a  
Domain Controller.  

A client will be considered an authenticated client if it uses a named pipe to communicate  
with the server or if it uses RPC Security. RPC Interfaces that have specifically requested to  
be accessible by unauthenticated clients may be exempt from this restriction, depending on  
the selected value for this policy setting.  

-- "None" allows all RPC clients to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which  
the policy setting is applied.  

-- "Authenticated " allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to  
connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied.  
Exemptions are granted to interfaces that have requested them.  

-- "Authenticated without exceptions " allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the  
definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy  
setting is applied. No exceptions are allowed. This value has the potential to cause  
serious problems and is not recommended.  

Note: This policy setting will not be applied until the system is rebooted.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Authenticated.  

Rationale:  

Unauthenticated RPC communication can create a security vulnerability.

18.8.40 Security Account Manager  

This section contains recommendations related to the Security Account Manager.  

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template SAM.admx/adml that is  
included with the Microsoft Windows 11 Release 21H2 Administrative Templates (or  
newer).  

18.8.40.1 (L1) Ensure 'Configure validation of ROCA-vulnerable WHfB  
keys during authentication' is set to 'Enabled: Audit' or higher (DC only)  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to configure how Domain Controllers handle Windows Hello  
for Business (WHfB) keys that are vulnerable to the "Return of Coppersmith´s attack"  
(ROCA) vulnerability.  

If this policy setting is enabled the following options are supported:  

Ignore: During authentication the Domain Controller will not probe any WHfB keys for the  
ROCA vulnerability.  

Audit: During authentication the Domain Controller will emit audit events for WHfB keys  
that are subject to the ROCA vulnerability (authentications will still succeed).  

Block: During authentication the Domain Controller will block the use of WHfB keys that  
are subject to the ROCA vulnerability (vulnerable authentications will fail).  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Audit. Configuring this setting to  
Enabled: Block also conforms to the benchmark.  

Note: This setting only takes effect on Domain Controllers.  

Note #2: A reboot is not required for changes to this setting to take effect.  

                                      

                                                                                                    679  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 681-----------------------

  

Rationale:  

The "Return of Coppersmith´s attack" or ROCA vulnerability is a cryptographic weakness in  
a widely used cryptographic library. An attacker can reveal secret keys (offline with no  
physical access to the affected device) on certified devices using this library.  

For more information on this vulnerability, visit ADV170012 - Security Update Guide -  
Microsoft - Vulnerability in TPM could allow Security Feature Bypass.  

Impact:  

This setting may affect vulnerable Trusted Platform Module  (TPMs). To avoid issues, this  
setting should not be set to Block until appropriate mitigations have been performed, for  
example patching of vulnerable TPMs.  

Audit:  

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as  
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:  

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\ 
SAM:SamNGCKeyROCAValidation  

Remediation:  

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled:  
Audit  (configuring to Enabled: Block also conforms to the benchmark):  

Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\System\Security  
Account Manager\Configure validation of ROCA-vulnerable WHfB keys during  
authentication  

Note: This Group Policy path may not exist by default. It is provided by the Group Policy  
template Sam.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 11 Release 21H2  
Administrative Templates (or newer).  

Default Value:  

Enabled: Audit. (Domain Controllers will default to using their local configuration. The  
default local configuration is Audit.)

Description:  

This policy setting specifies whether to enable or disable tracking of responsiveness events.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

When enabled the aggregated data of a given event will be transmitted to Microsoft. The  
option exists to restrict this feature for a specific user, set the consent level, and designate  
specific programs for which error reports could be sent. However, centrally restricting the  
ability to execute PerfTrack to limit the potential for unauthorized or undesired usage, data  
leakage, or unintentional communications is highly recommended.

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting specifies whether the Windows NTP Client is enabled. Enabling the  
Windows NTP Client allows your computer to synchronize its computer clock with other  
NTP servers. You might want to disable this service if you decide to use a third-party time  
provider.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

A reliable and accurate account of time is important for a number of services and security  
requirements, including but not limited to distributed applications, authentication services,  
multi-user databases and logging services. The use of an NTP client (with secure operation)  
establishes functional accuracy and is a focal point when reviewing security relevant  
events

(MS only) (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to specify whether the Windows NTP Server is enabled.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Note: In most enterprise managed environments, you should not disable the Windows NTP  
Server on Domain Controllers, as it is very important for the operation of NT5DS (domain  
hierarchy-based) time synchronization.

'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting lets you control whether Microsoft accounts are optional for Windows  
Store apps that require an account to sign in. This policy only affects Windows Store apps  
that support it.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Enabling this setting allows an organization to use their enterprise user accounts instead of  
using their Microsoft accounts when accessing Windows store apps. This provides the  
organization with greater control over relevant credentials. Microsoft accounts cannot be  
centrally managed and as such enterprise credential security policies cannot be applied to  
them, which could put any information accessed by using Microsoft accounts at risk.  

Impact:  

Windows Store apps that typically require a Microsoft account to sign in will allow users to  
sign in with an enterprise account instead.

18.9.8.2 (L1) Ensure 'Set the default behavior for AutoRun' is set to  
'Enabled: Do not execute any autorun commands' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting sets the default behavior for Autorun commands. Autorun commands  
are generally stored in autorun.inf files. They often launch the installation program or  
other routines.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Do not execute any autorun  
commands.  

Rationale:  

Prior to Windows Vista, when media containing an autorun command is inserted, the  
system will automatically execute the program without user intervention. This creates a  
major security concern as code may be executed without user's knowledge. The default  
behavior starting with Windows Vista is to prompt the user whether autorun command is  
to be run. The autorun command is represented as a handler in the Autoplay dialog.  

Impact:  

AutoRun commands will be completely disabled.

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

Autoplay starts to read from a drive as soon as you insert media in the drive, which causes  
the setup file for programs or audio media to start immediately. An attacker could use this  
feature to launch a program to damage the computer or data on the computer. Autoplay is  
disabled by default on some removable drive types, such as floppy disk and network drives,  
but not on CD-ROM drives.  

Note: You cannot use this policy setting to enable Autoplay on computer drives in which it  
is disabled by default, such as floppy disk and network drives.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: All drives.  

Rationale:  

An attacker could use this feature to launch a program to damage a client computer or data  
on the computer.

18.9.17.1 (L1) Ensure 'Allow Diagnostic Data' is set to 'Enabled:  
Diagnostic data off (not recommended)' or 'Enabled: Send required  
diagnostic data' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines the amount of diagnostic and usage data reported to  
Microsoft:  

        A value of (0) Diagnostic data off (not recommended). Using this value, no  
         diagnostic data is sent from the device. This value is only supported on Enterprise,  
         Education, and Server editions. If you choose this setting, devices in your  
         organization will still be secure.  
        A value of (1) Send required diagnostic data. This is the minimum diagnostic  
         data necessary to keep Windows secure, up to date, and performing as  
         expected. Using this value disables the Optional diagnostic data control in the  
         Settings app.  
        A value of (3)Send optional diagnostic data. Additional diagnostic data is  
         collected that helps us to detect, diagnose and fix issues, as well as make product  
         improvements. Required diagnostic data will always be included when you choose  
         to send optional diagnostic data. Optional diagnostic data can also include  
         diagnostic log files and crash dumps. Use the Limit Dump Collection and the Limit  
         Diagnostic Log Collection policies for more granular control of what optional  
         diagnostic data is sent.  

Windows telemetry settings apply to the Windows operating system and some first party  
apps. This setting does not apply to third party apps running on Windows 10/11.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Diagnostic data off (not  
recommended) or Enabled: Send required diagnostic data.  

Note: If your organization relies on Windows Update, the minimum recommended setting  
is Required diagnostic data. Because no Windows Update information is collected when  
diagnostic data is off, important information about update failures is not sent. Microsoft  
uses this information to fix the causes of those failures and improve the quality of updates.  

                                      

                                                                                                    725  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 727-----------------------

  

Note #2: The Configure diagnostic data opt-in settings user interface group policy can be  
used to prevent end users from changing their data collection settings.  

Note #3: Enhanced diagnostic data setting is not available on Windows 11 and Windows  
Server 2022 and has been replaced with policies that can control the amount of optional  
diagnostic data that is sent. For more information on these settings visit Manage diagnostic  
data using Group Policy and MDM  

Rationale:  

Sending any data to a 3rd party vendor is a security concern and should only be done on an  
as needed basis.  

Impact:  

Note that setting values of 0 or 1 will degrade certain experiences on the device.

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether users can access the Insider build controls in the  
Advanced Options for Windows Update. These controls are located under "Get Insider  
builds," and enable users to make their devices available for downloading and installing  
Windows preview software.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Note: This policy setting applies only to devices running Windows Server 2016, up until  
Release 1703. For Release 1709 or newer, Microsoft encourages using the Manage preview  
builds setting (recommendation title 'Manage preview builds'). We have kept this setting  
in the benchmark to ensure that any older builds of Windows Server 2016 in the  
environment are still enforced.  

Rationale:  

It can be risky for experimental features to be allowed in an enterprise managed  
environment because this can introduce bugs and security holes into systems, making it  
easier for an attacker to gain access. It is generally preferred to only use production-ready  
builds.

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template EMET.admx/adml that is

EMET is free and supported security software developed by Microsoft that allows an  
enterprise to apply exploit mitigations to applications that run on Windows. Many of these  
mitigations were later coded directly into Windows 10 and Server 2016.  

Note: Although EMET is quite effective at enhancing exploit protection on Windows server  
OSes prior to Server 2016, it is highly recommended that compatibility testing is done on  
typical server configurations (including all CIS-recommended EMET settings) before  
widespread deployment to your environment.  

Note #2: EMET has been reported to be very problematic on 32-bit OSes - we only  
recommend using it with 64-bit OSes.  

Note #3: Microsoft has announced that EMET will be End-Of-Life (EOL) on July 31, 2018.  
This does not mean the software will stop working, only that Microsoft will not update it  
any further past that date, nor troubleshoot new problems with it. They are instead  
recommending that servers be upgraded to Server 2016.

18.9.27.1.2 (L1) Ensure 'Application: Specify the maximum log file size  
(KB)' is set to 'Enabled: 32,768 or greater' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting specifies the maximum size of the log file in kilobytes. The maximum log  
file size can be configured between 1 megabyte (1,024 kilobytes) and 4 terabytes  
(4,194,240 kilobytes) in kilobyte increments.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 32,768 or greater.  

Rationale:  

If events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible to determine the root cause of  
system problems or the unauthorized activities of malicious users.  

Impact:  

When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention  
method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most  
recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention  
method so that older events are overwritten as needed.  

The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs.  
Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large  
number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be  
somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.  

Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft  
System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool.  
Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully  
compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring  
server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

18.9.27.3.2 (L1) Ensure 'Setup: Specify the maximum log file size (KB)' is  
set to 'Enabled: 32,768 or greater' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting specifies the maximum size of the log file in kilobytes. The maximum log  
file size can be configured between 1 megabyte (1,024 kilobytes) and 4 terabytes  
(4,194,240 kilobytes) in kilobyte increments.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 32,768 or greater.  

Rationale:  

If events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible to determine the root cause of  
system problems or the unauthorized activities of malicious users  

Impact:  

When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention  
method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most  
recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention  
method so that older events are overwritten as needed.  

The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs.  
Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large  
number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be  
somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.  

Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft  
System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool.  
Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully  
compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring  
server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

'Disabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

Without heap termination on corruption, legacy plug-in applications may continue to  
function when a File Explorer session has become corrupt. Ensuring that heap termination  
on corruption is active will prevent this.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

Allowing an application to function after its session has become corrupt increases the risk  
posture to the system.

18.9.31.4 (L1) Ensure 'Turn off shell protocol protected mode' is set to  
 'Disabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to configure the amount of functionality that the shell  
protocol can have. When using the full functionality of this protocol, applications can open  
folders and launch files. The protected mode reduces the functionality of this protocol  
allowing applications to only open a limited set of folders. Applications are not able to open  
files with this protocol when it is in the protected mode. It is recommended to leave this  
protocol in the protected mode to increase the security of Windows.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

Limiting the opening of files and folders to a limited set reduces the attack surface of the  
system.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

Description:

Rationale:  

This setting affects the location feature (e.g. GPS or other location tracking). From a

but there are legitimate uses, such as mapping software. However, they should not be used

18.9.46 Microsoft account  

This section contains recommendations related to Microsoft Accounts.  

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template MSAPolicy.admx/adml  
that is included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1703 Administrative Templates  
(or newer).  

18.9.46.1 (L1) Ensure 'Block all consumer Microsoft account user  
authentication' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting determines whether applications and services on the device can utilize new  
consumer Microsoft account authentication via the Windows OnlineID and  
WebAccountManager APIs.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Organizations that want to effectively implement identity management policies and  
maintain firm control of what accounts are used on their computers will probably want to  
block Microsoft accounts. Organizations may also need to block Microsoft accounts in order  
to meet the requirements of compliance standards that apply to their information systems.  

Impact:  

All applications and services on the device will be prevented from new authentications  
using consumer Microsoft accounts via the Windows OnlineID and WebAccountManager  
APIs. Authentications performed directly by the user in web browsers or in apps that use  
OAuth will remain unaffected.

WindowsDefender.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 8.1 & Server  
2012 R2 Administrative Templates (or newer).  

18.9.47.4.1 (L1) Ensure 'Configure local setting override for reporting to  
Microsoft MAPS' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting configures a local override for the configuration to join Microsoft Active  
Protection Service (MAPS), which Microsoft has now renamed to "Microsft Defender  
Antivirus Cloud Protection Service". This setting can only be set by Group Policy.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

The decision on whether or not to participate in Microsoft MAPS / Microsoft Defender  
Antivirus Cloud Protection Service for malicious software reporting should be made  
centrally in an enterprise managed environment, so that all computers within it behave  
consistently in that regard. Configuring this setting to Disabled ensures that the decision  
remains centrally managed.

None - this is the default behavior.

18.9.47.4.2 (L2) Ensure 'Join Microsoft MAPS' is set to 'Disabled'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to join Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS), which  
Microsoft has now renamed to Windows Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service and  
then Microsoft Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service. Microsoft MAPS / Microsoft  
Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service is the online community that helps you choose  
how to respond to potential threats. The community also helps stop the spread of new  
malicious software infections. You can choose to send basic or additional information about  
detected software. Additional information helps Microsoft create new definitions and help  
it to protect your computer.  

Possible options are:  

        (0x0) Disabled (default)  
        (0x1) Basic membership  
        (0x2) Advanced membership  

Basic membership will send basic information to Microsoft about software that has been  
detected including where the software came from the actions that you apply or that are  
applied automatically and whether the actions were successful.  

Advanced membership in addition to basic information will send more information to  
Microsoft about malicious software spyware and potentially unwanted software including  
the location of the software file names how the software operates and how it has impacted  
your computer.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

----------------------- Page 785-----------------------

  

Rationale:  

The information that would be sent can include things like location of detected items on  
your computer if harmful software was removed. The information would be automatically  
collected and sent. In some instances personal information might unintentionally be sent to  
Microsoft. However, Microsoft states that it will not use this information to identify you or  
contact you.  

For privacy reasons in high security environments, it is best to prevent these data  
submissions altogether.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

This section contains recommendations for MpEngine.  

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template  
WindowsDefender.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1703  
Administrative Templates (or newer).  

18.9.47.6.1 (L2) Ensure 'Enable file hash computation feature' is set to  
'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting determines whether hash values are computed for files scanned by Microsoft  
Defender.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

When running an antivirus solution such as Microsoft Defender Antivirus, it is important to  
ensure that it is configured to monitor for suspicious and known malicious activity. File  
hashes are a reliable way of detecting changes to files, and can speed up the scan process  
by skipping files that have not changed since they were last scanned and determined to be  
safe. A changed file hash can also be cause for additional scrutiny.  

Impact:  

This setting could cause performance degradation during initial deployment and for users  
where new executable content is frequently being created (such as software developers),  
or where applications are frequently installed or updated.  

For more information on this setting, please visit Security baseline (FINAL): Windows 10  
and Windows Server, version 2004 - Microsoft Tech Community -  1543631.  

Note: The impact of this setting should be monitored closely during deployment to ensure  
user and system performance impact is within acceptable limits.

18.9.47.12.2 (L1) Ensure 'Turn on e-mail scanning' is set to 'Enabled'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to configure e-mail scanning. When e-mail scanning is  
enabled, the engine will parse the mailbox and mail files, according to their specific format,  
in order to analyze the mail bodies and attachments. Several e-mail formats are currently  
supported, for example: pst (Outlook), dbx, mbx, mime (Outlook Express), binhex (Mac).  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Incoming e-mails should be scanned by an antivirus solution such as Microsoft Defender  
Antivirus, as email attachments are a commonly used attack vector to infiltrate computers  
with malicious software.  

Impact:  

E-mail scanning by Microsoft Defender Antivirus will be enabled.

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting controls detection and action for Potentially Unwanted Applications  
(PUA), which are sneaky unwanted application bundlers or their bundled applications, that  
can deliver adware or malware.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Block.  

For more information, see this link: Block potentially unwanted applications with Microsoft  
Defender Antivirus | Microsoft Docs  

Rationale:  

Potentially unwanted applications can increase the risk of your network being infected  
with malware, cause malware infections to be harder to identify, and can waste IT  
resources in cleaning up the applications. They should be blocked from installation.  

Impact:  

Applications that are identified by Microsoft as PUA will be blocked at download and install  
time.

18.9.47.16 (L1) Ensure 'Turn off Microsoft Defender AntiVirus' is set to  
'Disabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting turns off Microsoft Defender Antivirus. If the setting is configured to  
Disabled, Microsoft Defender Antivirus runs and computers are scanned for malware and  
other potentially unwanted software.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

It is important to ensure a current, updated antivirus product is scanning each computer  
for malicious file activity. Microsoft provides a competent solution out of the box in  
Microsoft Defender Antivirus.  

Organizations that choose to purchase a reputable 3rd-party antivirus solution may choose  
to exempt themselves from this recommendation in lieu of the commercial alternative.

18.9.58.1 (L1) Ensure 'Prevent the usage of OneDrive for file storage' is  
set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting lets you prevent apps and features from working with files on OneDrive  
using the Next Generation Sync Client.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Enabling this setting prevents users from accidentally (or intentionally) uploading  
confidential or sensitive corporate information to the OneDrive cloud service using the  
Next Generation Sync Client.  

Note: This security concern applies to any cloud-based file storage application installed on  
a server, not just the one supplied with Windows Server.

----------------------- Page 822-----------------------

  

Impact:  

Users can't access OneDrive from the OneDrive app and file picker. Windows Store apps  
can't access OneDrive using the WinRT API. OneDrive doesn't appear in the navigation pane  
in File Explorer. OneDrive files aren't kept in sync with the cloud. Users can't automatically  
upload photos and videos from the camera roll folder.  

Note: If your organization uses Office 365, be aware that this setting will prevent users  
from saving files to OneDrive/SkyDrive.  

Note #2: If your organization has decided to implement OneDrive for Business and  
therefore needs to except itself from this recommendation, we highly suggest that you also  
obtain and utilize the OneDrive.admx/adml template that is bundled with the latest  
OneDrive client, as noted at this link  (this template is not included with the Windows  
Administrative Templates). Two alternative OneDrive settings in particular from that  
template are worth your consideration:  

        Allow syncing OneDrive accounts for only specific organizations - a computer-based  
         setting that restricts OneDrive client connections to only approved tenant IDs.  
        Prevent users from synchronizing personal OneDrive accounts - a user-based setting

Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows  
Components\OneDrive\Prevent the usage of OneDrive for file storage  

Note: This Group Policy path may not exist by default. It is provided by the Group Policy  
template SkyDrive.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 8.1 & Server  
2012 R2 Administrative Templates (or newer). However, we strongly recommend you only  
use the version included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1607 & Server 2016  
Administrative Templates (or newer). Older versions of the templates had conflicting  
settings in different template files for both OneDrive & SkyDrive, until it was cleaned up  
properly in the above version.  

Note #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was named  
Prevent the usage of SkyDrive for file storage, but it was renamed starting with the Windows  
10 RTM (Release 1507) Administrative Templates.

'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting helps prevent Remote Desktop clients from saving passwords on a  
computer.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Note: If this policy setting was previously configured as Disabled or Not configured, any  
previously saved passwords will be deleted the first time a Remote Desktop client  
disconnects from any server.  

Rationale:  

An attacker with physical access to the computer may be able to break the protection  
guarding saved passwords. An attacker who compromises a user's account and connects to  
their computer could use saved passwords to gain access to additional hosts.  

Impact:

not be able to save passwords.

18.9.65.3.2.1 (L2) Ensure 'Restrict Remote Desktop Services users to a  
single Remote Desktop Services session' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to restrict users to a single Remote Desktop Services session.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

This setting ensures that users & administrators who Remote Desktop to a server will  
continue to use the same session - if they disconnect and reconnect, they will go back to the  
same session they were using before, preventing the creation of a second simultaneous  
session. This both prevents unnecessary resource usage by having the server host  
unnecessary additional sessions (which would put extra load on the server) and also  
ensures a consistency of experience for the user.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

18.9.65.3.3 Device and Resource Redirection  

This section contains recommendations related to Remote Desktop Session Host Device  
and Resource Redirection.  

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template  
TerminalServer.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows  
Administrative Templates.  

18.9.65.3.3.1 (L2) Ensure 'Do not allow COM port redirection' is set to  
'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting specifies whether to prevent the redirection of data to client COM ports  
from the remote computer in a Remote Desktop Services session.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

In a more security-sensitive environment, it is desirable to reduce the possible attack  
surface. The need for COM port redirection within a Remote Desktop session is very rare,  
so makes sense to reduce the number of unexpected avenues for data exfiltration and/or  
malicious code transfer.  

Impact:  

Users in a Remote Desktop Services session will not be able to redirect server data to local  
(client) COM ports.

18.9.65.3.3.2 (L1) Ensure 'Do not allow drive redirection' is set to  
'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting prevents users from sharing the local drives on their client computers to  
Remote Desktop Servers that they access. Mapped drives appear in the session folder tree  
in Windows Explorer in the following format:  

\\TSClient\<driveletter>$  

If local drives are shared they are left vulnerable to intruders who want to exploit the data  
that is stored on them.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Data could be forwarded from the user's Remote Desktop Services session to the user's  
local computer without any direct user interaction. Malicious software already present on a  
compromised server would have direct and stealthy disk access to the user's local  
computer during the Remote Desktop session.  

Impact:  

Drive redirection will not be possible. In most situations, traditional network drive  
mapping to file shares (including administrative shares) performed manually by the  
connected user will serve as a capable substitute to still allow file transfers when needed.

18.9.65.3.9 Security  

This section contains recommendations related to Remote Desktop Session Host Security.  

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template  
TerminalServer.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows  
Administrative Templates.  

18.9.65.3.9.1 (L1) Ensure 'Always prompt for password upon  
connection' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting specifies whether Remote Desktop Services always prompts the client  
computer for a password upon connection. You can use this policy setting to enforce a  
password prompt for users who log on to Remote Desktop Services, even if they already  
provided the password in the Remote Desktop Connection client.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Users have the option to store both their username and password when they create a new  
Remote Desktop Connection shortcut. If the server that runs Remote Desktop Services  
allows users who have used this feature to log on to the server but not enter their  
password, then it is possible that an attacker who has gained physical access to the user's  
computer could connect to a Remote Desktop Server through the Remote Desktop  
Connection shortcut, even though they may not know the user's password.  

Impact:  

Users cannot automatically log on to Remote Desktop Services by supplying their  
passwords in the Remote Desktop Connection client. They will be prompted for a password  
to log on.

18.9.65.3.9.2 (L1) Ensure 'Require secure RPC communication' is set to  
'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to specify whether Remote Desktop Services requires secure  
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) communication with all clients or allows unsecured  
communication.  

You can use this policy setting to strengthen the security of RPC communication with  
clients by allowing only authenticated and encrypted requests.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Allowing unsecure RPC communication can exposes the server to man in the middle attacks  
and data disclosure attacks.  

Impact:  

Remote Desktop Services accepts requests from RPC clients that support secure requests,  
and does not allow unsecured communication with untrusted clients.

18.9.65.3.9.3 (L1) Ensure 'Require use of specific security layer for  
remote (RDP) connections' is set to 'Enabled: SSL' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting specifies whether to require the use of a specific security layer to secure  
communications between clients and RD Session Host servers during Remote Desktop  
Protocol (RDP) connections.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: SSL.  

Note: In spite of this setting being labeled SSL, it is actually enforcing Transport Layer  
Security (TLS) version 1.0, not the older (and less secure) SSL protocol.  

Rationale:  

The native Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) encryption is now considered a weak protocol,  
so enforcing the use of stronger Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for all RDP  
communications between clients and RD Session Host servers is preferred.  

                                        

                                                                                                          848  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 850-----------------------

  

Impact:  

TLS 1.0 will be required to authenticate to the RD Session Host server. If TLS is not  
supported, the connection fails.  

Note: By default, this setting will use a self-signed certificate for RDP connections. If your  
organization has established the use of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for SSL/TLS  
encryption, then we recommend that you also configure the Server authentication  
certificate template setting to instruct RDP to use a certificate from your PKI instead of a  
self-signed one. Note that the certificate template used for this purpose must have “Client  
Authentication” configured as an Intended Purpose. Note also that a valid, non-expired  
certificate using the specified template must already be installed on the server for it to  
work.  

Note #2: Some third party two-factor authentication solutions (e.g. RSA Authentication  
Agent) can be negatively affected by this setting, as the SSL/TLS security layer will expect  
the user's Windows password upon initial connection attempt (before the RDP logon  
screen), and once successfully authenticated, pass the credential along to that Windows  
session on the RDP host (to complete the login). If a two-factor agent is present and  
expecting a different credential at the RDP logon screen, this initial connection may result  
in a failed logon attempt, and also effectively cause a “double logon” requirement for each  
and every new RDP session.

Default Value:  

Negotiate. (The most secure method that is supported by the client is enforced. If TLS is  
supported, it is used to authenticate the RD Session Host server. If TLS is not supported,  
native RDP encryption is used, but the RD Session Host server is not authenticated.)

18.9.65.3.9.4 (L1) Ensure 'Require user authentication for remote  
connections by using Network Level Authentication' is set to 'Enabled'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to specify whether to require user authentication for remote  
connections to the RD Session Host server by using Network Level Authentication.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Requiring that user authentication occur earlier in the remote connection process  
enhances security.  

Impact:  

Only client computers that support Network Level Authentication can connect to the RD  
Session Host server.  

Note: Some third party two-factor authentication solutions (e.g. RSA Authentication Agent)  
can be negatively affected by this setting, as Network Level Authentication will expect the

18.9.65.3.9.5 (L1) Ensure 'Set client connection encryption level' is set to  
 'Enabled: High Level' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting specifies whether to require the use of a specific encryption level to  
secure communications between client computers and RD Session Host servers during  
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections. This policy only applies when you are using  
native RDP encryption. However, native RDP encryption (as opposed to SSL encryption) is  
not recommended. This policy does not apply to SSL encryption.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: High Level.  

Rationale:  

If Remote Desktop client connections that use low level encryption are allowed, it is more  
likely that an attacker will be able to decrypt any captured Remote Desktop Services  
network traffic.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

18.9.65.3.10 Session Time Limits  

This section contains recommendations related to Remote Desktop Session Host Session  
Time Limits.  

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template  
TerminalServer.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows  
Administrative Templates.  

18.9.65.3.10.1 (L2) Ensure 'Set time limit for active but idle Remote  
Desktop Services sessions' is set to 'Enabled: 15 minutes or less, but not  
Never (0)' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to specify the maximum amount of time that an active  
Remote Desktop Services session can be idle (without user input) before it is automatically  
disconnected.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 15 minutes or less, but not  
Never (0).  

Rationale:  

This setting helps to prevent active Remote Desktop sessions from tying up the computer  
for long periods of time while not in use, preventing computing resources from being  
consumed by large numbers of inactive sessions. In addition, old, forgotten Remote  
Desktop sessions that are still active can cause password lockouts if the user's password  
has changed but the old session is still running. For systems that limit the number of  
connected users (e.g. servers in the default Administrative mode - 2 sessions only), other  
users' old but still active sessions can prevent another user from connecting, resulting in an  
effective denial of service.  

                                      

                                                                                                    855  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 857-----------------------

  

Impact:  

Remote Desktop Services will automatically disconnect active but idle sessions after 15  
minutes (or the specified amount of time). The user receives a warning two minutes before  
the session disconnects, which allows the user to press a key or move the mouse to keep  
the session active. Note that idle session time limits do not apply to console sessions.

18.9.65.3.10.2 (L2) Ensure 'Set time limit for disconnected sessions' is  
set to 'Enabled: 1 minute' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to configure a time limit for disconnected Remote Desktop  
Services sessions.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 1 minute.  

Rationale:  

This setting helps to prevent active Remote Desktop sessions from tying up the computer  
for long periods of time while not in use, preventing computing resources from being  
consumed by large numbers of disconnected but still active sessions. In addition, old,  
forgotten Remote Desktop sessions that are still active can cause password lockouts if the  
user's password has changed but the old session is still running. For systems that limit the  
number of connected users (e.g. servers in the default Administrative mode - 2 sessions  
only), other users' old but still active sessions can prevent another user from connecting,  
resulting in an effective denial of service. This setting is important to ensure a disconnected  
session is properly terminated.  

Impact:  

Disconnected Remote Desktop sessions are deleted from the server after 1 minute. Note  
that disconnected session time limits do not apply to console sessions.

18.9.65.3.11.2 (L1) Ensure 'Do not use temporary folders per session' is  
set to 'Disabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

By default, Remote Desktop Services creates a separate temporary folder on the RD Session  
Host server for each active session that a user maintains on the RD Session Host server. The  
temporary folder is created on the RD Session Host server in a Temp folder under the  
user's profile folder and is named with the sessionid. This temporary folder is used to  
store individual temporary files.  

To reclaim disk space, the temporary folder is deleted when the user logs off from a  
session.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

Disabling this setting keeps the cached data independent for each session, both reducing  
the chance of problems from shared cached data between sessions, and keeping possibly  
sensitive data separate to each user session.

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template  
AVSValidationGP.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 10 RTM  
(Release 1507) Administrative Templates (or newer).  

18.9.72.1 (L2) Ensure 'Turn off KMS Client Online AVS Validation' is set  
to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

The Key Management Service (KMS) is a Microsoft license activation method that entails  
setting up a local server to store the software licenses. The KMS server itself needs to  
connect to Microsoft to activate the KMS service, but subsequent on-network clients can  
activate Microsoft Windows OS and/or their Microsoft Office via the KMS server instead of  
connecting directly to Microsoft. This policy setting lets you opt-out of sending KMS client  
activation data to Microsoft automatically.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Even though the KMS licensing method does not require KMS clients to connect to  
Microsoft, they still send KMS client activation state data to Microsoft automatically.  
Preventing this information from being sent can help reduce privacy concerns in high  
security environments.  

Impact:  

The computer is prevented from sending data to Microsoft regarding its KMS client  
activation state.

set to 'Enabled: Warn and prevent bypass' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to manage the behavior of Windows SmartScreen. Windows  
SmartScreen helps keep PCs safer by warning users before running unrecognized programs  
downloaded from the Internet. Some information is sent to Microsoft about files and  
programs run on PCs with this feature enabled.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Warn and prevent bypass.  

Rationale:  

Windows SmartScreen helps keep PCs safer by warning users before running unrecognized  
programs downloaded from the Internet. However, due to the fact that some information is  
sent to Microsoft about files and programs run on PCs some organizations may prefer to  
disable it.  

Impact:  

Users will be warned before they are allowed to run unrecognized programs downloaded  
from the Internet.

This policy setting determines whether Windows Ink items are allowed above the lock  
screen.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: On, but disallow access above  
lock OR Disabled.  

Rationale:  

Allowing any apps to be accessed while system is locked is not recommended. If this  
feature is permitted, it should only be accessible once a user authenticates with the proper  
credentials.  

Impact:  

Windows Ink Workspace will not be permitted above the lock screen.

18.9.90 Windows Installer  

This section contains recommendations related to Windows Installer.  

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template MSI.admx/adml that is  
included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.  

18.9.90.1 (L1) Ensure 'Allow user control over installs' is set to 'Disabled'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting controls whether users are permitted to change installation options that  
typically are available only to system administrators. The security features of Windows  
Installer normally prevent users from changing installation options that are typically  
reserved for system administrators, such as specifying the directory to which files are  
installed. If Windows Installer detects that an installation package has permitted the user  
to change a protected option, it stops the installation and displays a message. These  
security features operate only when the installation program is running in a privileged  
security context in which it has access to directories denied to the user.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

In an enterprise managed environment, only IT staff with administrative rights should be  
installing or changing software on a system. Allowing users the ability to have any control  
over installs can risk unapproved software from being installed or removed from a system,  
which could cause the system to become vulnerable to compromise.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

18.9.90.2 (L1) Ensure 'Always install with elevated privileges' is set to  
 'Disabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting controls whether or not Windows Installer should use system permissions  
when it installs any program on the system.  

Note: This setting appears both in the Computer Configuration and User Configuration  
folders. To make this setting effective, you must enable the setting in both folders.  

Caution: If enabled, skilled users can take advantage of the permissions this setting grants  
to change their privileges and gain permanent access to restricted files and folders. Note  
that the User Configuration version of this setting is not guaranteed to be secure.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

Users with limited privileges can exploit this feature by creating a Windows Installer  
installation package that creates a new local account that belongs to the local built-in  
Administrators group, adds their current account to the local built-in Administrators group,  
installs malicious software, or performs other unauthorized activities.

Description:  

This policy setting controls whether a device will automatically sign-in the last interactive

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

Disabling this feature will prevent the caching of user's credentials and unauthorized use of  
the device, and also ensure the user is aware of the restart.  

Impact:  

The device does not store the user's credentials for automatic sign-in after a Windows

18.9.100 Windows PowerShell  

This section contains recommendations related to Windows PowerShell.  

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template  
PowerShellExecutionPolicy.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 8.0  
& Server 2012 (non-R2) Administrative Templates (or newer).  

18.9.100.1 (L1) Ensure 'Turn on PowerShell Script Block Logging' is set to  
'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting enables logging of all PowerShell script input to the Applications and  
Services Logs\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\Operational Event Log channel.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Note: If logging of Script Block Invocation Start/Stop Events is enabled (option box  
checked), PowerShell will log additional events when invocation of a command, script  
block, function, or script starts or stops. Enabling this option generates a high volume of  
event logs. CIS has intentionally chosen not to make a recommendation for this option,  
since it generates a large volume of events. If an organization chooses to enable the  
optional setting (checked), this also conforms to the benchmark.  

Rationale:  

Logs of PowerShell script input can be very valuable when performing forensic  
investigations of PowerShell attack incidents to determine what occurred.  

                                      

                                                                                                    895  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 897-----------------------

  

Impact:  

PowerShell script input will be logged to the Applications and Services  
Logs\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\Operational Event Log channel, which can contain  
credentials and sensitive information.  

Warning: There are potential risks of capturing credentials and sensitive information in  
the PowerShell logs, which could be exposed to users who have read-access to those logs.  
Microsoft provides a feature called "Protected Event Logging" to better secure event log  
data. For assistance with protecting event logging, visit: About Logging Windows -  
PowerShell | Microsoft Docs.

18.9.102.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Allow Basic authentication' is set to 'Disabled'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to manage whether the Windows Remote Management  
(WinRM) client uses Basic authentication.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

Basic authentication is less robust than other authentication methods available in WinRM  
because credentials including passwords are transmitted in plain text. An attacker who is  
able to capture packets on the network where WinRM is running may be able to determine  
the credentials used for accessing remote hosts via WinRM.

18.9.102.2 WinRM Service  

This section contains recommendations related to the Windows Remote Management  
(WinRM) service.  

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template  
WindowsRemoteManagement.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft  
Windows Administrative Templates.  

18.9.102.2.1 (L1) Ensure 'Allow Basic authentication' is set to 'Disabled'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to manage whether the Windows Remote Management  
(WinRM) service accepts Basic authentication from a remote client.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

Basic authentication is less robust than other authentication methods available in WinRM  
because credentials including passwords are transmitted in plain text. An attacker who is  
able to capture packets on the network where WinRM is running may be able to determine  
the credentials used for accessing remote hosts via WinRM.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

18.9.102.2.4 (L1) Ensure 'Disallow WinRM from storing RunAs  
credentials' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to manage whether the Windows Remote Management  
(WinRM) service will allow RunAs credentials to be stored for any plug-ins.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Note: If you enable and then disable this policy setting, any values that were previously  
configured for RunAsPassword will need to be reset.  

Rationale:  

Although the ability to store RunAs credentials is a convenient feature it increases the risk  
of account compromise slightly. For example, if you forget to lock your desktop before  
leaving it unattended for a few minutes another person could access not only the desktop  
of your computer but also any hosts you manage via WinRM with cached RunAs  
credentials.  

Impact:  

The WinRM service will not allow the RunAsUser or RunAsPassword configuration values to  
be set for any plug-ins. If a plug-in has already set the RunAsUser and RunAsPassword  
configuration values, the RunAsPassword configuration value will be erased from the  
credential store on the computer.  

If this setting is later Disabled again, any values that were previously configured for  
RunAsPassword will need to be reset.

18.9.103 Windows Remote Shell  

This section contains settings related to Windows Remote Shell (WinRS).  

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template  
WindowsRemoteShell.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft  
Windows Administrative Templates.  

18.9.103.1 (L2) Ensure 'Allow Remote Shell Access' is set to 'Disabled'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to manage configuration of remote access to all supported  
shells to execute scripts and commands.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Note: The GPME help text for this setting is incorrectly worded, implying that configuring it  
to Enabled will reject new Remote Shell connections, and setting it to Disabled will allow  
Remote Shell connections. The opposite is true (and is consistent with the title of the  
setting). This is a wording mistake by Microsoft in the Administrative Template.  

Rationale:  

Any feature is a potential avenue of attack, those that enable inbound network connections  
are particularly risky. Only enable the use of the Windows Remote Shell on trusted  
networks and when feasible employ additional controls such as IPsec.

----------------------- Page 917-----------------------

  

Impact:  

New Remote Shell connections are not allowed and are rejected by the server.  

Note: On Server 2012 (non-R2) and newer, due to design changes in the OS after Server  
2008 R2, configuring this setting as prescribed will prevent the ability to add or remove  
Roles and Features (even locally) via the GUI. We therefore recommend that the necessary  
Roles and Features be installed prior to configuring this setting on a Level 2 server.  
Alternatively, Roles and Features can still be added or removed using the PowerShell  
commands Add-WindowsFeature or Remove-WindowsFeature in the Server Manager  
module, even with this setting configured.

18.9.108.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'No auto-restart with logged on users for  
scheduled automatic updates installations' is set to 'Disabled'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting specifies that Automatic Updates will wait for computers to be restarted  
by the users who are logged on to them to complete a scheduled installation.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Note: This setting applies only when you configure Automatic Updates to perform  
scheduled update installations. If you configure the Configure Automatic Updates setting to  
Disabled, this setting has no effect.  

Rationale:  

Some security updates require that the computer be restarted to complete an installation. If  
the computer cannot restart automatically, then the most recent update will not completely  
install and no new updates will download to the computer until it is restarted. Without the  
auto-restart functionality, users who are not security-conscious may choose to indefinitely  
delay the restart, therefore keeping the computer in a less secure state.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

18.9.108.2.1 (L1) Ensure 'Configure Automatic Updates' is set to  
'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting specifies whether computers in your environment will receive security  
updates from Windows Update or WSUS. If you configure this policy setting to Enabled, the  
operating system will recognize when a network connection is available and then use the  
network connection to search Windows Update or your designated intranet site for  
updates that apply to them.  

After you configure this policy setting to Enabled, select one of the following three options  
in the Configure Automatic Updates Properties dialog box to specify how the service will  
work:  

        2 - Notify for download and auto install (Notify before downloading any updates)  
        3 - Auto download and notify for install (Download the updates automatically and  
         notify when they are ready to be installed.) (Default setting)  
        4 - Auto download and schedule the install (Automatically download updates and  
         install them on the schedule specified below.))  
        5 - Allow local admin to choose setting (Leave decision on above choices up to the  
         local Administrators (Not Recommended))  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Note: The sub-setting "Configure automatic updating:" has 4 possible values – all of them  
are valid depending on specific organizational needs, however if feasible we suggest using a  
value of  4 - Auto download and schedule the install. This suggestion is not a scored  
requirement.  

Note #2: Organizations that utilize a 3rd-party solution for patching may choose to exempt  
themselves from this recommendation, and instead configure it to Disabled so that the  
native Windows Update mechanism does not interfere with the 3rd-party patching process.  

                                      

                                                                                                     926  | P a g e   
  

----------------------- Page 928-----------------------

  

Rationale:  

Although each version of Windows is thoroughly tested before release, it is possible that  
problems will be discovered after the products are shipped. The Configure Automatic  
Updates setting can help you ensure that the computers in your environment will always  
have the most recent critical operating system updates and service packs installed.  

Impact:  

Critical operating system updates and service packs will be installed as necessary.  

Audit:  

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as  
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location:  

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU:NoAut 
oUpdate  

Remediation:  

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled:  

Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows  
Components\Windows Update\Manage end user experience\Configure Automatic  
Updates  

Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template  
WindowsUpdate.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows  
Administrative Templates.  

Default Value:  

Enabled: 3 - Auto download and notify for install. (Windows finds updates that apply to the  
computer and downloads them in the background (the user is not notified or interrupted  
during this process). When the downloads are complete, users will be notified that they are  
ready to install. After going to Windows Update, users can install them.)  

                                      

                                                                                                     927  | P a g e

18.9.108.2.2 (L1) Ensure 'Configure Automatic Updates: Scheduled  
install day' is set to '0 - Every day' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting specifies when computers in your environment will receive security  
updates from Windows Update or WSUS.  

The recommended state for this setting is: 0 - Every day.  

Note: This setting is only applicable if 4 - Auto download and schedule the install is  
selected in recommendation 'Configure Automatic Updates'. It will have no impact if any  
other option is selected.  

Rationale:  

Although each version of Windows is thoroughly tested before release, it is possible that  
problems will be discovered after the products are shipped. The Configure Automatic  
Updates setting can help you ensure that the computers in your environment will always  
have the most recent critical operating system updates and service packs installed.  

Impact:  

If 4 - Auto download and schedule the install is selected in recommendation  
'Configure Automatic Updates', critical operating system updates and service packs will  
automatically download every day (at 3:00 A.M., by default).

18.9.108.4.1 (L1) Ensure 'Manage preview builds' is set to 'Disabled'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting manage which updates that are receive prior to the update being  
released.  

Dev Channel: Ideal for highly technical users. Insiders in the Dev Channel will receive  
builds from our active development branch that is earliest in a development cycle. These  
builds are not matched to a specific Windows 10 release.  

Beta Channel: Ideal for feature explorers who want to see upcoming Windows 10 features.  
Your feedback will be especially important here as it will help our engineers ensure key  
issues are fixed before a major release.  

Release Preview Channel (default): Insiders in the Release Preview Channel will have  
access to the upcoming release of Windows 10 prior to it being released to the world. These  
builds are supported by Microsoft. The Release Preview Channel is where we recommend  
companies preview and validate upcoming Windows 10 releases before broad deployment  
within their organization.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Note: Preview Build enrollment requires a telemetry level setting of 2 or higher and your  
domain registered on insider.windows.com. For additional information on Preview Builds,  
see: https://aka.ms/wipforbiz  

Rationale:  

It can be risky for experimental features to be allowed in an enterprise managed  
environment because this can introduce bugs and security holes into systems, making it  
easier for an attacker to gain access. It is generally preferred to only use production-ready  
builds.  

Impact:  

Preview builds are prevented from installing on the device.

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines when Preview Build or Feature Updates are received.  

Defer Updates This enables devices to defer taking the next Feature Update available to  
your channel for up to 14 days for all the pre-release channels and up to 365 days for the  
Semi-Annual Channel. Or, if the device is updating from the Semi-Annual Channel, a version  
for the device to move to and/or stay on until the policy is updated or the device reaches  
end of service can be specified. Note: If you set both policies, the version specified will take  
precedence and the deferrals will not be in effect. Please see the Windows Release  
Information page for OS version information.  

Pause Updates To prevent Feature Updates from being received on their scheduled time,  
you can temporarily pause Feature Updates. The pause will remain in effect for 35 days  
from the specified start date or until the field is cleared (Quality Updates will still be  
offered).  

Note: If the "Allow Diagnostic Data" (formerly "Allow Telemetry") policy is set to 0, this  
policy will have no effect.  

Note #2: Starting with Windows 10 R1607, Microsoft introduced a new Windows Update  
(WU) client behavior called Dual Scan, with an eye to cloud-based update management. In  
some cases, this Dual Scan feature can interfere with Windows Updates from Windows  
Server Update Services (WSUS) and/or manual WU updates. If you are using WSUS in your  
environment, you may need to set the above setting to Not Configured or configure the  
setting Do not allow update deferral policies to cause scans against Windows Update  (added  
in the Windows 10 Release 1709 Administrative Templates) in order to prevent the Dual  
Scan feature from interfering. More information on Dual Scan is available at these links:  

        Demystifying “Dual Scan” – WSUS Product Team Blog  
        Improving Dual Scan on 1607 – WSUS Product Team Blog  

Note #3: Prior to Windows 10 R1703, values above 180 days are not recognized by the OS.  
Starting with Windows 10 R1703, the maximum number of days you can defer is 365 days.  

                                                                                                  935  | P a g e

Rationale:  

In a production environment, it is preferred to only use software and features that are

19.1.3.1 (L1) Ensure 'Enable screen saver' is set to 'Enabled'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting enables/disables the use of desktop screen savers.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

If a user forgets to lock their computer when they walk away, it is possible that a passerby  
will hijack it. Configuring a timed screen saver with password lock will help to protect  
against these hijacks.  

Impact:  

A screen saver runs, provided that the following two conditions hold: First, a valid screen  
saver on the client is specified through the recommendation Force specific screen saver or  
through Control Panel on the client computer. Second, the recommendation Screen saver  
timeout is set to a nonzero value through the setting or through Control Panel.

Description:  

This setting determines whether screen savers used on the computer are password  
protected.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

19.1.3.3 (L1) Ensure 'Screen saver timeout' is set to 'Enabled: 900  
seconds or fewer, but not 0' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting specifies how much user idle time must elapse before the screen saver is  
launched.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 900 seconds or fewer, but not 0.  

Note: This setting has no effect under the following circumstances:  

        The wait time is set to zero.  
        The "Enable Screen Saver" setting is disabled.  
        A valid screen existing saver is not selected manually or via the "Screen saver  
         executable name" setting  

Rationale:  

If a user forgets to lock their computer when they walk away, it is possible that a passerby  
will hijack it. Configuring a timed screen saver with password lock will help to protect  
against these hijacks.  

Impact:  

The screen saver will automatically activate when the computer has been left unattended

AttachmentManager.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows  
Administrative Templates.  

19.7.4.1 (L1) Ensure 'Do not preserve zone information in file  
attachments' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting allows you to manage whether Windows marks file attachments with  
information about their zone of origin (such as restricted, Internet, intranet, local). This  
requires NTFS in order to function correctly, and will fail without notice on FAT32. By not  
preserving the zone information, Windows cannot make proper risk assessments.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Note: The Attachment Manager feature warns users when opening or executing files which  
are marked as being from an untrusted source, unless/until the file's zone information has  
been removed via the "Unblock" button on the file's properties or via a separate tool such  
as Microsoft Sysinternals Streams.  

Rationale:  

A file that is downloaded from a computer in the Internet or Restricted Sites zone may be  
moved to a location that makes it appear safe, like an intranet file share, and executed by an  
unsuspecting user. The Attachment Manager feature will warn users when opening or  
executing files which are marked as being from an untrusted source, unless/until the file's  
zone information has been removed.

19.7.4.2 (L1) Ensure 'Notify antivirus programs when opening  
attachments' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting manages the behavior for notifying registered antivirus programs. If  
multiple programs are registered, they will all be notified.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Note: An updated antivirus program must be installed for this policy setting to function  
properly.  

Rationale:  

Antivirus programs that do not perform on-access checks may not be able to scan  
downloaded files.  

Impact:  

Windows tells the registered antivirus program(s) to scan the file when a user opens a file  
attachment. If the antivirus program fails, the attachment is blocked from being opened.

is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting determines if Windows can use diagnostic data to provide tailored experiences  
to the user.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Tracking, collection and utilization of personalized data is a privacy and security issue that  
is of concern to many organizations.  

Impact:  

Windows will not use diagnostic data from this device (this data may include browser, app  
and feature usage, depending on the "Diagnostic and usage data" setting value) to  
customize content shown on the lock screen, Windows tips, Microsoft consumer features  
and other related features. If these features are enabled, users will still see  
recommendations, tips and offers, but they may be less personalized.

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting lets you turn off all Windows Spotlight features at once.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Note: Per Microsoft TechNet, this policy setting only applies to Windows 10 Enterprise and  
Windows 10 Education editions.  

Rationale:  

Enabling this setting will help ensure your data is not shared with any third party. The  
Windows Spotlight feature collects data and uses that data to display suggested apps as  
well as images from the internet.  

Impact:  

Windows Spotlight on lock screen, Windows tips, Microsoft consumer features and other

Description:  

This policy setting removes the Spotlight collection setting in Personalization, rendering  
the user unable to select and subsequently download daily images from Microsoft to the  
system desktop.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

Enabling this setting will help ensure your data is not shared with any third party. The  
Windows Spotlight feature collects data and uses that data to display images from  
Microsoft.  

Impact:  

The Spotlight collection feature will not be available as an option in Personalization

19.7.28 Network Sharing  

This section contains recommendations related to Network Sharing.  

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template Sharing.admx/adml  
that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.  

19.7.28.1 (L1) Ensure 'Prevent users from sharing files within their  
profile.' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This policy setting determines whether users can share files within their profile. By default,  
users are allowed to share files within their profile to other users on their network after an  
administrator opts in the computer. An administrator can opt in the computer by using the  
sharing wizard to share a file within their profile.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

If not properly configured, a user could accidentally share sensitive data with unauthorized  
users. In an enterprise managed environment, the company should provide a managed  
location for file sharing, such as a file server or SharePoint, instead of the user sharing files  
directly from their own user profile.  

Impact:  

Users cannot share files within their profile using the sharing wizard. Also, the sharing  
wizard cannot create a share at %root%\Users and can only be used to create SMB shares  
on folders.  

                                       

                                                                                                       978  | P a g e

19.7.43 Windows Installer  

This section contains recommendations related to Windows Installer.  

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template MSI.admx/adml that is  
included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.  

19.7.43.1 (L1) Ensure 'Always install with elevated privileges' is set to  
'Disabled' (Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 1 - Domain Controller  

  Level 1 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting controls whether or not Windows Installer should use system permissions  
when it installs any program on the system.  

Note: This setting appears both in the Computer Configuration and User Configuration  
folders. To make this setting effective, you must enable the setting in both folders.  

Caution: If enabled, skilled users can take advantage of the permissions this setting grants  
to change their privileges and gain permanent access to restricted files and folders. Note  
that the User Configuration version of this setting is not guaranteed to be secure.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  

Rationale:  

Users with limited privileges can exploit this feature by creating a Windows Installer  
installation package that creates a new local account that belongs to the local built-in  
Administrators group, adds their current account to the local built-in Administrators group,  
installs malicious software, or performs other unauthorized activities.  

Impact:  

None - this is the default behavior.

WindowsMediaPlayer.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft  
Windows Administrative Templates.  

19.7.47.2.1 (L2) Ensure 'Prevent Codec Download' is set to 'Enabled'  
(Automated)  

Profile Applicability:  

  Level 2 - Domain Controller  

  Level 2 - Member Server  

Description:  

This setting controls whether Windows Media Player is allowed to download additional  
codecs for decoding media files it does not already understand.  

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  

Rationale:  

This has some potential for risk if a malicious data file is opened in Media Player that  
requires an additional codec to be installed. If a special codec is required for a necessary  
job function, then that codec should first be tested to ensure it is legitimate, and it should  
be supplied by the IT department in the organization.  

Impact:  

Windows Media Player is prevented from automatically downloading codecs to your  
computer. In addition, the Download codecs automatically check box on the Player tab in  
the Player is not available.
