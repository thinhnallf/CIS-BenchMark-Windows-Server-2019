""password."" In Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer, passphrases can be quite long and can  
include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as ""I want to drink a $5 milkshake"" is a valid  
passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of  
random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about  
the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password  
length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length

 Ensure 'Password must meet complexity requirements' is set   to 'Enabled' (Automated),"This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements  
for strong passwords.  

When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements:  

        Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two  
         consecutive characters  
        Be at least six characters in length  
        Contain characters from three of the following categories:  
              o   English uppercase characters (A through Z)  
              o   English lowercase characters (a through z)  
              o   Base 10 digits (0 through 9)  
              o   Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %)  
              o   A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does not fall under the  
                  previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific.  

Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For  
instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267  
(approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per  
second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes  
to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527  
combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without  
punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011)  
possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000  
attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember,  
these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other  
special keyboard characters such as ""!"" or ""@"". Proper use of the password settings can  
help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack.
